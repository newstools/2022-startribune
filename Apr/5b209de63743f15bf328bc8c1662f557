An early Monday fire in the basement of a Rochester church caused considerable damage, but an alarm system and sprinklers kept things from becoming worse. Alerted to a blaze at the Peace United Church of Christ just after 2 a.m., firefighters arrived to find thick black smoke filling the building at 1503 2nd Av. NE., Fire Department spokesman K.C. Clark said.  The fire broke out in the church's lower level between the sanctuary and an attached preschool. A portable water extinguisher was used to put out the main fire. An overhead sprinkler that had activated before firefighters arrived helped keep the fire from spreading, Clark said. Damage was mainly confined to the area of the blaze, but there was a significant smoke on the main and lower levels, Clark said. "Nearly all parts of the church will need remediation due to the smoke," Clark said. "Things might have been much worse had the church not had an automatic smoke and fire alarm. Had the building not been protected by an alarm system, it is likely the building would have sustained significant fire damage." No one was in the building at the time, and no firefighters were hurt, Clark said. A damage estimate was not immediately available. Officials have not determined a cause.
