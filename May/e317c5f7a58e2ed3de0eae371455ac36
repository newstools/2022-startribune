A towboat rammed into a lock and dam on the Mississippi River late Saturday near Wabasha, Minn., authorities said Monday. The incident occurred on the Wisconsin side of the river, the Buffalo County Sheriff's Office said. Workers late Sunday morning removed the towboat from the lock and dam, which suffered some damage, Chief Sheriff's Deputy Lee Engfer said. According to the Sheriff's Office: A barge, owned by the Canal Barge Co., was heading south shortly after 11 p.m., when its towboat went out of control and struck the lock and dam. No one aboard the towboat or among the lock and dam staff was hurt.  An investigation continues into the cause of the mishap.
