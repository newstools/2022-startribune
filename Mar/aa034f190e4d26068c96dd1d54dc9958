DULUTH — Five northern Minnesota colleges will open next fall under one name: Minnesota North College. The merger of the five schools that make up the Northeast Higher Education District — Hibbing, Itasca, Vermilion and Rainy River community colleges and Mesabi Range College — was approved Wednesday by Minnesota State Colleges and Universities' board of trustees. The six campuses that serve the five schools will remain open under the consolidation plan, and are considered a single accredited institution. "Operationally merging our institutions leverages the resources, talents, and marketability that comes with a larger, regional college yet maintains the long-cherished individual campus identities and community connections, said Michael Raich, president of the newly formed college, in a news release. Minnesota State Colleges and Universities has been working toward the merger for two years. The schools saw enrollment fall 35% in the past decade and have some of the smallest student populations among the three dozen Minnesota State Colleges and Universities . Enrollment at the five schools last fall was just shy of 3,500. The state Department of Iron Range Resources & Rehabilitation (IRRR) offered an $820,000 grant to make the consolidation happen. Under the new model, students can access more courses and career programs and apply with a single transcript and application, simplifying the process for those who take classes at more than one institution, officials say. Campuses are located in Ely, Grand Rapids, Eveleth, Virginia, International Falls and Hibbing. The name officially changes in late May.
