Minnesota's Mall of America community vaccination site could start taking appointments as soon as Monday to administer COVID-19 shots to preschoolers, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Wednesday. Walz issued a statement following news that a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel voted Wednesday to recommend COVID vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna for children age 6 months to 5 years old. Minnesota health care providers can't give the shots until the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issues a formal recommendation — a decision that could come this weekend. Should the CDC recommend the vaccine for children as young as 6 months old, the Mall of America community vaccination site will begin administering the vaccine as soon as June 22, Walz said in the statement. A network of 400 Minnesota clinics, retail sites and pharmacies would be ready as well within days of vaccine arrival. "Many families have ... long waited for their children to get a COVID-19 shot to help prevent severe illness and keep children in the classroom and activities," Walz said.
