 A hepatitis A outbreak possibly connected to organic strawberries is being investigated by Minnesota health and agriculture officials. One case of the illness has been identified in the state and another in North Dakota, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported.  The FDA said FreshKampo and H-E-B brand strawberries bought from March 5 to April 25 were the likely cause of the outbreak. Retailers who sold the strawberries include Aldi, Trader Joe's and Walmart. State investigators said there could be more than a single case in Minnesota. "As with most foodborne illness investigations, we expect that there could be other cases of illness out there, but they may not be aware of the connection," Agriculture Department spokeswoman Alida Sorenson said. Hepatitis A is a contagious virus that can cause liver disease. Infection through contaminated food or water is less common than contracting it from  close contact with someone who is infected. The FDA linked the outbreak to 17 cases in the U.S. and 12 hospitalizations. All but two of the cases were in California. Additional cases were reported in Canada. The Texas-based H-E-B  grocery chain said Sunday on its website that ""No illnesses from strawberries related to the FDA investigation have been reported at H-E-B or in Texas. … H-E-B has not received or sold organic strawberries from the supplier under investigation since April 16." Producer FreshKampo is based in Mexico. The FDA said additional products may be included as its investigation continued.
