  These days, our furry companions join us in all sorts of activities, from dining at restaurants to yoga class ("doga"). And when we don't want to drink alone, there's Busch Dog Brew — an alcohol-free bone broth that represents Anheuser-Busch's foray into the realm of animal beverages. (For those unaware, dog drinks, such as bacon-flavored electrolyte-boosted dog water, have been a pet pampering trend for some time.) Busch has sold four-packs of the original pork variety since 2020, and is now holding a "bark bracket" to choose the face of its new, yet-to-be-revealed flavor. After soliciting contenders on social media, Busch selected a Minnesota pooch named Kira as a finalist. When she was a puppy, Kira was found by police officers before being adopted via the Humane Society, Voters can make their pick on social media through March 27 and the winner will be announced on the 29th. "Kira has some tough competition with the other pups in the 'Final Fur,' but her fun-loving attitude could be exactly what we need on our can," noted Krystyn Stowe, head of marketing for the Busch brands. And should Kira get the gig, Busch offers good opportunities for mentorship and career growth. The company already employs two rescue pups as its Chief Tasting Officer and Senior Vice Pawsident of Human Relations.
