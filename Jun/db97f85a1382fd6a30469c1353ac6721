Blaine • golf VanArragon didn't need to put any pressure on herself to be at her best in the Class 3A state tournament. The stellar competition provided all the incentive she needed for the two-day event. The Bengals junior shot a 9-under-par 135 to earn medalist honors for the second time at Bunker Hills Golf Club in Coon Rapids. She won her initial title as a seventh-grader in 2018. "All the pressure I needed came from the people around me," VanArragon said. "It was such a competitive field." 2019 state champion Isabella McCauley of Simley finished second and defending state champ Reese McCauley, Isabella's younger sister, finished third. "It's good to push yourself," VanArragon said. "You have to work hard to have success." A first-round 7-under-par 65 propelled her to victory. She followed it up with a 70 and won by two strokes. "It was a couple of pretty fun days," VanArragon said. "It was stressful but so rewarding."
