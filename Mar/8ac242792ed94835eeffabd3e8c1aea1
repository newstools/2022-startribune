A 51-year-old driver was high on drugs late last spring when he crossed into the wrong lane of a Carver County highway and killed the other driver in a head-on crash, a newly filed criminal complaint is alleging. Daniel Wittenberg of Excelsior was charged Wednesday in Carver County District Court with criminal vehicular homicide in connection with the collision that occurred about 2:40 p.m. June 14 along Hwy. 7 at Polk Avenue in Watertown Township. Ramona J. Wakefield, 58, of Dassel, Minn., died in the crash. Wittenberg was charged by summons and is due in court April 22. Court records did not list an attorney for him. Messages were left for Wittenberg seeking a response to the allegations. A blood test revealed Wittenberg had fentanyl, oxycodone and other potent drugs in his system at the time of the crash, authorities said.
