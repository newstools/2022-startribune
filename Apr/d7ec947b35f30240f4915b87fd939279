More than $1 million has flowed to campaigns in the crowded race to fill the rest of the late U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn's term representing southern Minnesota's First Congressional District. The latest round of federal campaign finance reports shows Albert Lea attorney Matt Benda brought in more than $168,000 as he tries to break out of the Republican field of candidates that includes Hagedorn's widow and former Minnesota's Republican Party chair Jennifer Carnahan and former U.S. Department of Agriculture official Brad Finstad. "I have been frustrated that some of my opponents are claiming they are political outsiders when I think their resume suggests differently," Benda said in an interview. "And I think the reason my campaign has traction is the authenticity of my candidacy." The new reports covering the first three months of 2022 paint the clearest picture yet of how the most-competitive congressional races in Minnesota are shaping up in the critical midterm election cycle. Democrats hold a narrow majority in Congress, and the party is in danger of losing the House and Senate this fall. While the First Congressional District has been a swing seat, Hagedorn, a Republican, won what was then a Democrat-held seat in the 2018 midterms. Early voting has already started for the special May 24 primary. An August special election will follow to fill the remainder of Hagedorn's current term. Finstad reported bringing in more than $156,000, including his own donation of $5,800 to his campaign, and he closed the quarter with around $150,000. Carnahan collected nearly $151,400, including about $8,000 of her own money, with a little more than $121,000 remaining. Even though Benda raised more than his competitors, he also benefited from a $15,000 loan he made to his campaign and closed out March with over $170,000. GOP state Rep. Jeremy Munson has the largest cash advantage of any candidate with help from a $200,000 loan he made to his campaign. Munson raised more than $102,000 and reported having more than $297,000 left in his campaign account. Fellow GOP state Rep. Nels Pierson loaned $100,000 to his campaign and raised another 11,000. On the Democratic side, former Hormel Foods CEO Jeff Ettinger led with more than $148,000 in total receipts and around $143,000 left. "I have told all the folks that I've raised money from that I do intend to invest in my own campaign as well," Ettinger said during a phone interview. Trailing Ettinger on the DFL side is Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer who worked for President George W. Bush's administration. He brought in more than $22,000 and reported a little more than $17,000 left.  Former political consultant Sarah Brakebill-Hacke, a DFLer, raised close to $3,500 with a $750 personal donation to her campaign. In a race on track to be Minnesota's most competitive congressional midterm contest this fall, Second District Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig brought in $1 million, and her campaign ended the quarter with more than $3.6 million on hand. "I continue to be blown away by the incredible levels of enthusiasm and excitement that are the driving force behind our campaign," Craig said in a statement. Republican challenger Tyler Kistner raised more than $490,000 and reported having close to $424,000 left to spend. "Our campaign has continued to gain momentum over the first part of 2022 by securing the unanimous endorsement from the Delegates of the Second Congressional District GOP and the endorsement of numerous high-profile Republicans across the country," Kistner said in a statement. In the Twin Cities, two DFL members of Congress face competitive primaries. In St. Paul's Fourth Congressional District, longtime incumbent U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum outraised DFL challenger Amane Badhasso. McCollum brought in more than $476,000 while Badhasso reported raising more than $298,000, with McCollum having a cash advantage of more than $400,000 in the bank. In the Fifth Congressional District covering Minneapolis, two-term U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar was outraised by former Minneapolis City Council Member Don Samuels, who kicked off a Democratic primary bid in March. Samuels brought in about $352,000 while Omar raised a little less than$276,000. Omar has close to $493,000 in her campaign account; Samuels' campaign reported having a little more than $318,000. "Our strong fundraising totals demonstrate a growing support for a different approach to political leadership than what we've seen from Rep. Omar," Samuels' campaign manager Joe Radinovich said in a statement. Both Omar and Samuels were outraised by GOP candidate Cicely Davis, though the Davis campaign reported total receipts of around $545,000 and spending of about $550,000, leaving her campaign with less than $98,000. Fellow Republican candidate Royce White raised more than $206,000 and has more than $184,000 on hand. "Like last time, it's clear that Republicans and corporate Democrats are heavily invested in removing one of the most principled, effective advocates of the working class from Congress," Omar campaign spokesman Isi Baehr-Breen said in a text message about the latest round of fundraising reports. "And like last time, they'll spend a small fortune and fail." Among the state's other congressional races, Third District Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips has a large financial advantage over a field of GOP challengers, while Minnesota's three House Republicans continued to steadily add to their coffers. In northern Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District, DFL state Rep. Jennifer Schultz raised over $68,000 after launching her challenge to incumbent GOP Rep. Pete Stauber just days before the fundraising quarter ended March 31. But Stauber has the advantage of being an established incumbent in a year that many polls show to be favorable for Republicans. Stauber's campaign reported raising more than $290,000 while boasting close to $979,000 in cash.
