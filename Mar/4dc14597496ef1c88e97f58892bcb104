A Minneapolis man has been sentenced to probation for vandalism and other acts of violence during the civil unrest that gripped Portland, Ore., after George Floyd's murder in May 2020.  Adrian De Los Rios, 33, was placed on three years' probation and ordered to pay $6,500 in restitution to the city after pleading guilty in Multnomah County Circuit Court to unlawful use of weapon, rioting and criminal mischief. Federal charges against De Los Rios were dismissed. During the unrest on Aug. 5, 2020, protesters blocked traffic outside the Portland Police Department's East Precinct and began tearing off the boards protecting the building's windows. After the city declared an unlawful assembly shortly before 10 p.m., police ordered the crowd to disperse. De Los Rios threw chunks of concrete at the building's glass and struck the glass with a hammer. He also set a trash can on fire a foot from the front door, put a piece of lumber in the flames and leaned the burning can against the building. Video surveillance showed him placing a 2-by-4 through the door handles and ramming the doors with a 4-by-4 piece of lumber. Later that night, officers saw De Los Rios throw "multiple baseball-size rocks" at police, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. On one occasion, De Los Rios threw a rock at an officer while holding additional rocks in his opposite hand. Portland was the scene of sometimes violent protests and rioting after Floyd, who was Black, died while pinned under Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's knee. Chauvin, who is white, has been convicted of murder and imprisoned. Three other officers have been convicted in federal court of violating Floyd's civil rights and are scheduled to have their state trial begin in June.
