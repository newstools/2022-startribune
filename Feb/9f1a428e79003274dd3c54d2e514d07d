   We may never know why, in God's name, a subset of cold-dwellers insists on wearing shorts in winter. But Wisconsin-based Leinenkugel's brewery hopes its new heated shorts will optimize the quirky practice once described as "both ridiculous and rebellious, crackpot and courageous, a kind of middle finger at both The Man and Winter." On sale today at 11 a.m., for $55 a pair (leinie.com/sandyshorts), the limited-edition Leinie's shorts have heating elements (powered by rechargeable battery) in the legs, an external bottle holster, and a cheerful lemon print to celebrate the return of the brewer's seasonal, citrus-spiked Summer Shandy. Inspired by those who bare their calves in winter, Leinenkugel's wanted to insure such hardy folk could keep their summer vibe going year-round, with warm bods and cold beers, noted senior marketing manager Matthew Ferebee. "We see brave souls, all throughout the winter months, who refuse to let the cold get to them and showcase their true Midwestern strength by baring their legs." Should Leinie's need a spokesperson for its Shandy Shorts, might we suggest University of Minnesota student Miles, who went viral after being photographed by the Star Tribune wearing shorts in frigid temps (and declining to give his last name because his mom "would be mad at him for how he was dressed").
