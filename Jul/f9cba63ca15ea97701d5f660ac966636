Look for the first Canada geese to fly again. The adults have been flightless since about mid-June or a bit later while they molted their wing feathers. The young that hatched this spring also test their new flight feathers, so whole family groups can be seen airborne. Mallards and other ducks also are starting to fly again after their molt. Juvenile purple martins make their first flights at this time. One brood of young is raised each summer by martins here in the Upper Midwest. After the nesting season has ended each summer, martins gather into assembly groups before leaving the area. The early migration of martins comes to a peak in the second half of August in Minnesota. The birds leave for their winter home in Brazil. While there they feed on insects in the air, as usual, but they do not nest. Their homing instincts are strong and a good share will return to the same Minnesota nesting spots in the spring of 2023. During hot afternoons it's not unusual to see American robins or other birds perched quietly in the shade with their bills wide open, panting. Birds have no sweat glands so this is their way to get ride of excess body heat. Deer flies have hit their population peak and should be gone, or nearly gone, by the end of July. For now they continue to bother people, dogs and a few wild animals. Deer head for lakes to get some relief from these pests.
