WIMBLEDON, England  — The Latest from Wimbledon (all times local): ___ 3:45 p.m. American teenager Coco Gauff rebounded from a set down to beat Elena-Gabriela Ruse 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in the first round at Wimbledon. The 18-year-old Gauff was the runner-up at the French Open but needed three sets to get past the 54th-ranked Romanian. The 11th-seeded Gauff got the go-ahead break in the third set at 5-5 on her sixth break point of the game when Ruse double-faulted. Gauff accumulated 25 break points but converted only four. Ruse was more efficient on break points, converting four of six. Ruse made more than twice as many unforced errors: 54 to Gauff's 26. Gauff reached the fourth round in her previous two appearances at Wimbledon. ___ 2:55 p.m. Top-ranked Iga Swiatek extended her winning streak to 36 matches — the longest run on the women's tour since 1997.
