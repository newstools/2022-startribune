Authorities on Tuesday identified the man who was shot and killed last week in his home near George Floyd Square in south Minneapolis. Kirk D. Lee, 46, died from a gunshot to the torso late Friday in the 3800 block of S. Chicago Avenue, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said. Officers called to the scene found Lee wounded and gave him medical aid, police said. Emergency responders took Lee to HCMC, where he died that night. A 36-year-old man was arrested Sunday night and has yet to be charged. The Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged. Police ask anyone with information to call CrimeStoppers at 800-222-8477 or submit a tip at crimestoppersmn.org.
