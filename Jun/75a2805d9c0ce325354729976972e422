A 15-year-old boy was shot in the leg Friday night during a melee in southeast Minneapolis, police said. Police found the wounded teenager in a backyard after they responded to reports of a large crowd disturbance and fights at 11:20 p.m. in the 1700 block of University Avenue. Officers heard gunshots when they arrived, and the scene turned chaotic as people fled. The teen, who reportedly suffered a noncritical gunshot wound, was treated at the scene and taken by ambulance to a hospital. No one was arrested.    Police said the residence where the boy was found has been a haven for criminal behavior and site of large disturbances in the past. The home is now boarded up. Officers from the Second Precinct initially responded to the disturbance and were later aided by officers from three other precincts and the University of Minnesota Police Department. The Minnesota State Patrol provided air support.
