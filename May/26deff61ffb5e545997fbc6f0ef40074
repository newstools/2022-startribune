Twenty Minnesota community leaders, ranging from a suburban mayor seeking to make public safety more equitable to nonprofit officials boosting culturally specific mental health and Hmong language skills, have received Bush fellowships to further their education and training. The St. Paul-based Bush Foundation on Thursday announced the latest recipients of its prestigious annual fellowships. The winners — selected out of nearly 500 applicants from Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and 23 Native American nations in the three states — will each get up to $100,000 to fund leadership opportunities.
