An 18-year-old man died from injuries suffered when fireworks exploded near his face early Monday in Brooklyn Park — Minnesota's first reported fireworks-related death this year. Brooklyn Park Police found the man with severe wounds to his hands and face after they were called about 1:30 a.m. to near the 9800 block of Fallgold Parkway North. A friend was performing CPR when officers arrived. The man died at North Memorial Hospital. His identity was not released.  Across the country, nine people died last year from fireworks-related injuries. In Minnesota, fireworks fatalities are rare. An Apple Valley man died in 2021 after he was hit by a firework. Before then, the last fireworks-related fatality in the state was in 2015, according to the State Fire Marshal Division. In 2021, 17 Minnesotans were injured by fireworks, down from 78 in 2020, according to the agency.  In Hugo, authorities said a garage fire Sunday night may have been started by fireworks. Firefighters put out the blaze before it could spread to nearby houses. The State Fire Marshal Division recommends several safety tips when using fireworks, including following the manufacturer's instructions, pointing fireworks away from people and not trying to relight a dud. Minnesota outlaws fireworks that explode in or shoot into the air but allows sparklers, fountain fireworks that sit on the ground and ground spinners or other similar fireworks.
