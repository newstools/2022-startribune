There's been an uptick in the scope and number of Juneteenth festivities in the Twin Cities this year. While that may be partly due to the waning pandemic, recognition of our newest national holiday is likely being fueled by a rise in equality activism and pride of heritage. Local celebrations, which honor African American culture, feature storytelling, readings, kids activities and live performances as well as food vendors and markets.
