On his first tour since 2016-17, he is promoting last year's hit-filled "Justice." Despite the title and a couple samples of Martin Luther King speeches, this is mostly a collection of pop and R&B-tinged love songs. With the new disc, Bieber become the first male artist to have his first six studio albums debut at No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. Material from "Justice," including "Ghost" and "Peaches," will dominate the concert setlist. But Bieber hasn't forgotten about "Baby" and "Sorry." Opening are Eddie Benjamin, Teo and Jaden, son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. (7:30 p.m. Fri. Target Center, 600 1st Av. N., Mpls., $62.50-$202.50, axs.com) Kassa Overall: The mixing of hip-hop and jazz has evolved into an organically soluble genre of its own, and Overall is in the vanguard of it. The Seattle-raised, Brooklyn-based drummer-rapper-producer studied at Oberlin with current master drummer Billy Hart and has forged his own path since his 2019 debut, "Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz." During the pandemic, Overall released two remix albums in homage to DJ-producer Madlib. By turns playful, political and sonically profound, "Shades of Flu" puts songs by everyone from Jon Batiste to Archie Shepp in a blender without sapping their essence.

Mentored by Prince for a time, she embraces the au courant chill R&B on her latest, 2021's "Temporary Highs in the Violet Skies," addressing a turbulent relationship with grace instead of volume. Tyler, the Creator ups the energy with a verse on the breezy "Neon Peach," her latest single, and adds to the highlight, the lusciously melodic "In the Moment." (8 p.m. Armory, 500 6th S. St., Mpls., $34 and up, ticketmaster.com) Stewart Copeland: The Police's drummer has had a long career scoring music for film and television. But he's also composed operas and oratorios.
