Golden Valley police said Friday that along with looking for the car and any suspects involved in a drive-by shooting last week, they also have yet to find the SUV targeted by the gunfire or the person driving that vehicle when his passenger was shot. The latest disclosure came as police released surveillance video and photos from where the gunfire occurred about 8:35 p.m. Feb. 19 near Duluth Street and Regent Avenue N. The images show a possible suspect and a vehicle that police think are connected to the shooting. Authorities believe the suspect or suspects were in a light-colored sedan with yellow headlights that fled east on Golden Valley Road. There may have been two people in the car, police said. The driver of the SUV "left the scene [alone] before we arrived, and we have yet to be able to catch up with him," police detective Sgt. Randy Mahlen said. The SUV also has not been located, Mahlen said. The woman, who initially was reported to be in critical condition, was taken from the scene by ambulance to a nearby hospital and has since been released, Mahlen said. Police have not disclosed her identity. "She has been able to provide a little bit of information," Mahlen said. Mahlen said the shooting was not a case of road rage, but he did not elaborate further about a motive. "This is an incident that seriously harmed someone and has created concern in our community," Interim Police Chief Scott Nadeau said in a statement. "We hope that our community is able to assist us by providing information that will allow us to hold the offender accountable." On Tuesday, police announced that the Golden Valley Crime Prevention Fund put up $5,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the shooting.  Authorities have yet to address a possible motive in the shooting. Tips can be submitted to police by calling 763-593-8079 or e-mailing police@goldenvalleymn.gov.
