Nick Swardson is coming home. The Twin Cities-raised comic will perform June 3 and 4 at Mystic Lake Casino. They are his first big shows in the area since a 2019 concert at Treasure Island Casino. In addition to doing stand-up to sold-out audiences across the country, Swardson has starred in a string of successful movies, including "Grandma's Boy" and "The Beachwarmers." Don't be surprised if the card-carrying member of Adam Sandler's Rat Pack also does some unannounced sets at smaller clubs in the area. He spent much of December 2018 popping up at various venues in Minneapolis. Tickets for the Mystic Lake shows, which start at $39, are currently available at mysticlake.com
