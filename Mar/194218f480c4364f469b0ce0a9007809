The Mall of America will be decked out in all things basketball this week in anticipation of the women's Final Four and feature a celebration of the 50th anniversary of Title IX — a fitting location, then, for the Star Tribune Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame induction ceremony. The eight inductees into the Hall are all history-making women, chosen in part to recognize the historic 50-year mark. We will celebrate these women at 5:30 p.m. in the Mall's Huntington Bank Rotunda on Wednesday evening. The event is free for Star Tribune readers and the public. The Class of 2021 being inducted on Wednesday: Read more about each of them here, and please join us on Wednesday evening at the Mall of America and help us celebrate these incredible women.
