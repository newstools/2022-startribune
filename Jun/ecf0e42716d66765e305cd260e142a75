A standoff between an armed suspect and law enforcement in St. Michael, Minn., entered its 12th hour Wednesday morning, authorities said. Events began to unfold Tuesday evening when Wright County deputies were sent to Central Avenue on a call about a man carrying a rifle and arguing with a woman. Police subsequently surrounded a home and the suspect has fired several shots at law enforcement, a statement from the Wright County Sheriff's Office said. Those living in the immediate vicinity of the home have been notified to evacuate due to the "volatile nature of this incident," the sheriff's office said. Several roads in the area have been closed due to concerns about public safety, and people are asked to stay away from the area, the sheriff's office said. The suspect, a 39-year-old man, has active warrants for his arrest for domestic assault and a convicted felon possessing a firearm. The Wright County Sheriff's Office and other law enforcement agencies remained on the scene as of 9:15 a.m.
