Also nominated is Grade 3 Lexington winner Tawny Port who most recently finished seventh in the Kentucky Derby. The 3-year-old, who has never raced on the turf, is trained by Brad Cox who nominated five others to Canterbury's richest race.

Among them is Minnesota-bred Bens Malice, trained by David Van Winkle and owned and bred by Pete Mattson.
