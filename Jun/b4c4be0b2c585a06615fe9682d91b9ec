A 31-year-old Brooklyn Park man died Friday morning in a one-vehicle crash on Hwy. 610 in Brooklyn Park. The name of the man, who was the lone occupant of the vehicle, has not been released. The man was heading east on Hwy. 610 when his Volkswagen Jetta left the road about 5:25 a.m., rolled into the right ditch and struck a bridge pillar near Hwy. 252, the State Patrol said. There was no evidence of impairment, the patrol said. Authorities closed the eastbound lanes of Hwy. 610 for about three hours as they investigated. Traffic was diverted onto southbound Hwy. 252 until the lanes reopened about 8:15 a.m.
