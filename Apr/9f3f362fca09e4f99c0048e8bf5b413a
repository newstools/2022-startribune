Introduction: The Wolves' 124-96 loss to Memphis on Tuesday was predictable and unwatchable on multiple levels. Memphis had far more urgency than Minnesota after losing Game 1 at home, and the Grizzlies played to their strengths with depth, defensive tenacity and offensive rebounding. The Wolves, meanwhile, tried to generate too much offense in isolation and suffered through a night with Karl-Anthony Towns in foul trouble. It was a grinding game early, making it hard to watch — if you could watch at all. Problems with blackouts and streaming services left many fans angry. 7:00: Marcus Fuller joins host Michael Rand for a breakdown of the Gophers men's basketball team's efforts in the transfer portal.
