Jeimer Candelario hit a two-run home run in the top of the tenth inning to lift the Tigers to a 4-2 victory over the Twins on Wednesday afternoon, ending Minnesota's six-game winning streak. Candelario connected off reliever Trevor Megill before a rain-soaked crowd of 20,375 at Target Field. The Twins loaded the bases in the bottom of the tenth with no outs, but Michael Fullmer struck out Carlos Correa, and Andrew Chafin struck out Max Kepler and got Gary Sanchez to pop out. Trevor Larnach's first homer of the season, a two-run shot in the fourth, gave the Twins a 2-0 lead but Harold Castro homered in the sixth and eighth innings — after hitting only nine homers in his first 799 major league at-bats — to tie the score. The Twins still took the series 2-1 and are now 27-17, sitting five games ahead of second-place Chicago in the American League Central. Twins starter Dylan Bundy pitched 5⅔ innings and allowed only five hits — including Castro's first homer — and one walk. He departed with two outs in the sixth inning with six strikeouts. Griffin Jax and Joe Smith each pitched ⅔ of an inning of scoreless relief, but Emilio Pagan took the mound in the eighth and Castro smacked his second homer on the second pitch. On a bullpen day for Detroit, starter Rony Garcia went four innings, giving up three hits and two runs with two walks and five strikeouts. Alex Lange (1-1) picked up the win as the fifth of the Tigers' seven pitchers. Both teams threatened in the ninth. Miguel Cabrera pinch-hit for Harold Castro with the bases loaded, but was called out on a 3-2 pitch from Caleb Thielbar. The Twins had runners at second and third in the ninth, but Gilberto Celestino grounded out to end the threat and send the game into extra innings.
