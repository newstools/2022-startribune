Structural changes at Minnesota Public Radio are triggering significant shuffling at the media company and at least one major departure. Dave Kansas is leaving as chief operating officer of American Public Media Group, MPR's parent company. He has been with the company since 2011. Jean Taylor, who took over as APM president last fall, made the announcement in a memo that went out to staff last week. Taylor, who previously served as chair for the Star Tribune board, wrote that the company will now work as a single organization that will encourage more collaboration and alignment. In the past, divisions between APM and MPR could be confusing for both radio audiences and employees. In the memo, Taylor praised Kansas for his contributions over the past decade, which included steering the growth of "Marketplace" and accelerating on-demand content. MPR president Duchesne Drew, a former assistant managing editor at the Star Tribune, will pick up additional duties, including oversight of "Marketplace" and "APM Reports." Chandra Kavati, the vice president of distribution and underwriting, will be promoted to the new role of senior vice president of chief partnerships and revenue officer, reporting directly to Taylor. "This is a great organization and my role is to ensure it remains relevant and impactful far into the future," Taylor wrote. "After listening and thinking critically, the dissolution of the two divisions is our path forward to working better."
