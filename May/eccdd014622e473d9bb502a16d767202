A man and a woman shot to death Thursday afternoon in Robbinsdale have been identified. Damone Marcel Rhodes, 28, and Aaronesia Ortezia Clark, 24, died from multiple gunshot wounds, according to a statement from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office on Saturday. The office gave a hometown only for Clark, who was from Minneapolis. They were found in a blue sedan on County Road 81 near 36th Avenue and Crystal Lake. At least 15 bullet holes peppered the windows and door frame. A short time later, investigators found the suspect's vehicle abandoned in north Minneapolis. Robbinsdale police on Thursday said they do not believe the shooting to be a random act and maintained there is no further risk to the public.
