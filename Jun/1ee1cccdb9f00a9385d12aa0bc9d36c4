Starting Monday, yard waste pickup is switching from weekly to every other week for some parts of Minneapolis to adjust for a staffing shortage. The lack of workers this summer has  already forced cuts to yard waste services in other metro cities. In Minneapolis, the impacted neighborhoods are: The city's Solid Waste and Recycling employees collect yard waste in those areas, said city spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie. Minneapolis Refuse Inc. covers the other half of the city, and by contract their collection of yard waste will remain weekly. Because service is not being suspended entirely, there will be no reimbursement for impacted residents, McKenzie said. The city's yard waste collection web page includes a map showing where service is changing. Residents are advised to continue leaving their yard waste containers at the curb or alley until collection, and call Solid Waste and Recycling at 612-673-2917 if they haven't had a pickup for more than two weeks. Collection for most impacted residents will continue to be the same day of the week, but for others that might change as well, according to a city news release. Residents are  asked to refer to the online yard waste pick-up map to check their pickup days. Residents can also call Solid Waste and Recycling, but city offices will be closed June 20 to observe Juneteenth. The Hennepin County website includes information for yard waste drop-off locations. It also has tips for backyard composting, an eco-friendly way to use up yard waste and create  fertilizer for gardening.
