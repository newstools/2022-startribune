A man died in a golf cart crash at his home in western Hennepin County, authorities said. The incident occurred in the 4000 block of Windmill Drive in Independence, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said. The Medical Examiner's Office identified the man who died at the scene late Wednesday afternoon as 82-year-old Norman C. Wenck. West Hennepin Police Chief Gary Kroells said Tuesday that Wenck was driving the cart down some landscape steps during a chore, when the vehicle rolled over "and he ended up beneath it." Kroells said, "It's just tragic. ... You're just trying to do stuff at home." Norman Wenck served on the Independence City Council from 2007-2015. In 1985, Norman Wenck founded the civil engineering firm Wenck Associates in Maple Plain. The company had about 300 employees when he retired, said son Josh Wenck.
