A 20-year-old motorist has been charged with being drunk when she sped off an interstate ramp in St. Paul last summer, crashed and killed her passenger. Reshawna E. Mosley of Minneapolis was charged Tuesday in Ramsey County District Court with five counts of criminal vehicular homicide in the fatal crash on the Shepard Road entrance ramp to southbound Interstate 35E. Shaterries M. Barlow, 19, of Minneapolis died in the crash. Court records did not list an attorney for Mosley. A warrant has been issued for her arrest. A blood test taken two hours after the crash showed Mosley had a blood alcohol content of 0.085%, above Minnesota's legal limit of 0.08%,  the charges read. THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, reportedly also was present in her system. A half-empty bottle of alcohol and a small amount of marijuana were found in the car, the charges noted. According to the criminal complaint: Emergency responders arrived at the scene about 12:30 a.m. July 22 and declared Barlow dead at the scene. Mosley suffered less serious injuries. Mosley told police that she had a few tequila drinks shortly before driving. She said she was following another vehicle and guessed she was traveling 45 to 50 mph  when she went off the ramp, where the speed limit is 30 mph, and landed in a ditch. "She said that her passenger ... told her to 'slow down' just before the crash," the complaint read. Investigators determined the car was traveling 99 mph about 5 seconds before the airbag deployed, and 30 mph upon deployment. "Taking variables into account," the charges read, "the reconstructionist determined that the [car] was traveling at a minimum of 56 miles per hour prior to the crash."
