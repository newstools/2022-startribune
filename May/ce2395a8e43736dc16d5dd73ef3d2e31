A 19-year-old University of Minnesota student has not been seen since Sunday morning and is the subject of a law enforcement search, according to authorities. Austin Ray Retterath was last known to be outside in the area of East River Road and E. Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis, near the Mississippi River, according to a public alert issued by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). Retterath, whose family is from Woodbury, is described as white, about 6 feet tall and 160 pounds, with blond hair. He was last seen wearing a blue T-shirt, dark shorts and white shoes, the BCA said. "The University of Minnesota police are currently searching for him and are concerned for his safety," the BCA alert said. Law enforcement has yet to specify a time when Retterath was last seen or whether he was with other people. University spokesman Jake Ricker said in an e-mail, "I'm not aware of any organized civilian searches, but law enforcement is actively searching for him at this time. I don't have all the details on this, but I believe the search has included near/in the river." Anyone with information about Retterath's whereabouts is urged to contact campus police at 612-624-2677. Retterath's Instagram account lists him as being in the U's Class of 2025. In fall 2021, he was among the students who made the dean's list in the College of Science and Engineering.
