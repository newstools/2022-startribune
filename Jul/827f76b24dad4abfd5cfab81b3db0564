Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve usually wouldn't go to the WNBA All-Star Game if she didn't have to. The season is a grind, and a weekend off is nice. But Reeve is in Chicago this weekend, for a simple reason: "It's Syl's last All-Star Game," she said. Since announcing 2022 season would be her last, Fowles — an eight-time All-Star, 10-time all-defensive team player and four-time Defensive Player of the Year — has been doing her retirement tour around the league. On Sunday, she will say goodbye to the All-Star Game. Fowles and Seattle guard Sue Bird — both of whom have announced their impending retirement — will be co-captains as the league uses the weekend to honor two of the best players ever to play the game. Fowles is a one-time MVP, two-time WNBA Finals MVP and the league's career leader in defensive rebounds (currently 2,775), total rebounds (3,878) and shooting percentage (.599). Bird is the league's all-time leader in assists (3,154) and was named an All-Star for a record 13th time.
