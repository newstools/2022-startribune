The return of rabbits, birds and butterflies is a welcome sight for winter-weary Minnesotans tired of the gray and white landscape. Print artists from across the state capture the joy of the changing seasons in intricate carvings on wood, metal or stone, then bring them to life with dyes and paints pressed to paper. To Emily Gray Koehler (emilygraykoehler.com), the way a wood block becomes a printed work of art is as natural as the transition of winter to spring. "Just as the mechanisms of printmaking guide my hand, my heart is inspired by the wonders of the cycles of nature," she says. Her works depict bees both in man-made hives and exploring spring flowers. Kendra Gebbia of Ink Orchard (kendragebbia.com) explores the transformative nature of printmaking in a different way. After pulling a piece from the block, she embellishes her works with oil paints to create unique versions of each print. She turns her art into wall frames, like those shown here, as well as lamps, and sells the carved block itself after she's finished its print run. Betsy Bowen (woodcut.com) draws inspiration from her surroundings in Grand Marais, depicting prairies and cedar forests with traditional woodblock prints. Bowen's work also includes book illustrations, calendars, postcards and shirts.
