The Gophers' Gable Steveson left his shoes on the mat, a sign of retirement in wrestling, after defeating Arizona State's Cohlton Schultz in his final collegiate match in the NCAA championships on Saturday in Detroit. Steveson's college career ended with a 85-2 record, two national titles and three consecutive undefeated seasons. Two-thirds of his matches (58 of 85) were victories by pins or by margins of eight points or more. FRESHMAN YEAR 2018-19 Record: 35-2 Regular season def. Austin Emerson, Nebraska, 15-6 def.
