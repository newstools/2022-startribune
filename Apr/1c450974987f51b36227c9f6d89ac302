Barry Wohler's bright smile was as big as they come, overshadowed only by his perfectly feathered hair. He personified the GQ look of an All-American kid. That was the Barry Wohler of 1980 and 1981, when he led Bird Island-Lake Lillian to two Class A boys' basketball championships. Expect that same look to be displayed again Thursday, when Wohler joins 14 others in the third class to be inducted into the Minnesota High School Basketball Hall of Fame. "I was kind of surprised when I was notified, honored," Wohler said. "I wasn't expecting it. It's going to be pretty cool." The ceremony will be held Thursday at the Lumber Exchange Event Center in Minneapolis starting at 3 p.m. Tickets ($25) will be available at the door. Bird Island-Lake Lillian won each of those titles in double overtime, defeating Lake of the Woods 78-74 in the final in 1980 and Winona Cotter 49-47 in 1981. "It was really kind of storybook," Wohler said. Wohler, a point guard and lefthanded shooter, made a 23-footer with five seconds remaining to beat Winona Cotter for the second title. He finished with 28 points. "It's amazing how many people remember our run and still bring it up 40 years later," he said. "All our games were close." Wohler, a native of Bird Island, didn't just celebrate those championships with his childhood friends but also with his coach and father, Jerry. Barry Wohler has compiled a 363-209 record as a high school coach himself, currently at Orono. He also won a state championship (Class 3A) with his son, Brady, in 2011. "I had a great opportunity playing for my dad and the excitement we shared together winning those two state titles," Wohler said. "I really have great memories from my playing days. "It was a group of kids that grew up together and had a dream. It's a bond that never breaks. The camaraderie is still there 40 years later." He'll be inducted alongside basketball standouts ranging from a woman who dominated as a girl in the '80s to a coach fresh off a state championship game only days ago to a game official who made a difference in high school and then took his skills to college. "When I saw the names, I was like, 'My goodness,'" Wohler said. "I am fortunate to be going in with these people."
