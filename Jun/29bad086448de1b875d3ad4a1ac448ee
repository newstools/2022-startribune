Authorities on Thursday identified the bicyclist who was hit by a light-rail train in St. Paul a day earlier and died. Jason L'Heureux, 50, of St. Paul was killed Wednesday morning after being struck by a  westbound Green Line train about 10:30 a.m. at the Raymond Avenue station along University Avenue, Metro Transit spokeswoman Laura Baenen said. One witness to the incident wrote that the train traveled more than a block from where the bicyclist was hit until it came to a halt. A second witness, who also lives nearby, came out to the scene and saw the man trapped between the first and second cars.
