Southern Minnesota was being hit with severe weather Tuesday night. The National Weather Service in Shakopee issued a hazardous weather outlook for Carver, Scott and Dakota counties near the Twin Cities metro area, along with roughly the I-90 corridor counties of Lac Qui Parle, Swift, Chippewa, Kandiyohi, Meeker, Yellow Medicine, Renville, McLeod, Sibley, Redwood, Brown, Nicollet, Le Sueur, Rice. Goodhue, Watonwan, Blue Earth, Waseca, Steele Martin, Faribault and Freeborn. Locally damaging wind gusts are the primary concern, but large hail pummeled Sioux Falls on Tuesday afternoon. The National Weather Service also shared reports of flash flooding in Albert Lea, Minn. The Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center was calling the system a derecho that was moving through southwestern Minnesota and northwestern Iowa. The Weather Service reported wind gusts as powerful as up to 70 mph. In the Twin Cities, skies late Tuesday were drawing attention with a strong orange-yellow tint before sunset. The Weather Service gave this explanation on Twitter: "Behind thunderstorms in the evening, high clouds remain. The setting sun emits light that is bent with longer wavelengths. While the blue (shorter) wavelengths are scattered out, the yellow-orange-red part of the spectrum remain, thus producing the sky we're seeing tonight."
