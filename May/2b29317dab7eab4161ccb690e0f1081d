A motorcyclist driving in south Minneapolis crashed twice Thursday night with the second wreck leading to his death. The victim, whose name has not been released, is believed to have hit a transit bus at the intersection of E. 32nd Street and Minnehaha Avenue shortly after 8 p.m. Officers went to the scene and saw the bus with crash damage, but no sign of a motorcycle, said Minneapolis police spokesman Garrett Parten. Minutes later, officers were called to E. 35th Street and Minnehaha Avenue for another crash involving a motorcycle. Preliminary information indicates the same motorcyclist ran a red light and struck a car, Parten said. Officers and paramedics rendered aid the scene and took the victim to a hospital where the man in his 50s was pronounced dead, Parten said. No other injuries were reported, Parten said.
