DULUTH — A Duluth man is accused of attempted murder after stabbing his pregnant partner several times while she slept next to their 1-year-old child. Anthony Holloway, 35, was charged Friday with second-degree attempted murder and child endangerment. He was arrested last week after police received calls from both Holloway and a neighbor. Holloway told a dispatcher he had stabbed his partner. The victim was asleep with their child curled up near her stomach when Holloway began stabbing her in the back on Wednesday, a complaint says. In all, he stabbed her more than a dozen times, piercing her heart. She was able to escape their apartment and seek help. The 1-year-old was not injured, and the victim is in stable condition at a Duluth hospital. The complaint says Holloway has previously threatened the victim with a knife.
