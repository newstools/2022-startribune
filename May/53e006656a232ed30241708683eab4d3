OAKLAND, Calif. — The Twins and A's conclude their three-game series this afternoon (2:37 p.m., BSN) at the Coliseum. The A's won Tuesday night to square the series at one. Sonny Gray seeks his first victory as a Twin. He is 0-1, with a 3.68 ERA, and will face A's righthander Daulton Jefferies (1-6, 4.84). Carlos Correa was reinstated from the 10-day injury list and will start at shortstop, with Royce Lewis sent back to St. Paul after an impressive big league debut. Correa missed 11 games because of a right middle finger contusion. Gray was a first-round pick (18th overall) by Oakland in 2011 out of Vanderbilt and spent seven seasons in the Oakland organization. In five major league seasons, he was 44-36 with a 3.42 ERA in 114 games for the A's before he was traded to the Yankees in 2017. The Twins lead the American League Central at 21-16, and the rebuilding A's are 16-23 and last in the AL West.
