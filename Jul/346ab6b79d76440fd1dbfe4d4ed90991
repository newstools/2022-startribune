Two young men and two teenagers were wounded in a shootout Wednesday evening in St. Cloud, police said. Police said witnesses reported a heated verbal dispute between two groups in the 1000 block of 11th Street S. At some point, shots were fired by several people with handguns, hitting the four known victims. Police said the cause of the altercation is under investigation, but it appears to be related to a fight that had occurred the previous evening between the two groups. One victim was found lying on a sidewalk near the shooting site, while the other three managed to make their way to the hospital. The male victims include a 21-year-old from St. Cloud who suffered a gunshot wound to the head, another 21-year-old from St. Cloud with a gunshot wound to the chest, a 19-year-old from Mora with a gunshot wound to the elbow and a 15-year-old from St. Cloud with a gunshot wound to the shoulder and neck. Three of the four victims are hospitalized in stable condition. The incident remains under investigation.
