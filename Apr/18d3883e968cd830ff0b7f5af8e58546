A preliminary autopsy found that Iliana "Lily" Peters died of strangulation and blunt force trauma, the Chippewa County (Wis.) Coroner said Thursday. The 10-year-old girl's death was a homicide, said coroner Ronald Patten. Lily's body was found Monday morning a few blocks from the Chippewa Falls house where she was last seen. Her father reported her missing the night before. Authorities arrested a 14-year-old boy and charged him Wednesday with first-degree homicide and sexual assault. He is being held at a juvenile detention facility on $1 million cash bail.
