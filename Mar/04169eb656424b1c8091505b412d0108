Perhaps the saddest thing about Minnesota pro sports, as a collective, is that the period of time that stands out as a de facto "golden era" was a period about 20 years ago filled with woulda, coulda, shoulda finishes. The Vikings (2000), Twins (2002), Wild (2003) and Wolves (2004) all reached the conference finals/title game of their respective leagues in a five-season span. All of them lost. And by the time the Lynx were stacking four championships together in the next decade, the rest of the teams in this market were generally somewhere between OK and bad. Eras are generally only defined in retrospect — something that is being reinforced as I read Chuck Klosterman's very interesting and too-close-to-home book, "The Nineties" — but here at the start of 2022 something feels like it is brewing in Minnesota sports. On Friday's Daily Delivery podcast, I took a stab at guessing which of our six major pro sports teams is most likely to win a championship in the next five years. Here, let's settle for something equally ambitious, at least on scale: All six could make the playoffs in their 2022 seasons. It is likely that one or two of these teams won't pull through. This is Minnesota, after all. But the potential for all of them is there, which hasn't been the case for as long as I can remember.
