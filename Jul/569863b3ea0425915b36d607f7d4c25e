St. Paul police on Monday continued to search for the driver who was involved in a hit-and-run crash that left a woman in her 70s dead and her husband in the hospital. The driver and passengers of a Kia Sport ran from the scene on foot after colliding with the woman's car near the intersection of Magnolia Avenue and Forest Street about 10 p.m. Sunday. The Kia had been reported stolen out of Minneapolis, said Sgt. David McCabe with the St. Paul Police Department. The woman, who was driving the other car, died of her injuries at the scene. A male passenger, identified as her husband, was taken to a hospital. He was expected to recover, McCabe said. Their names have not been released. Police used K9 Unit dogs and called in the Minnesota State Patrol Flight Section helicopter in an effort to search for those who ran from the scene, McCabe said. Investigators from the St. Paul Traffic and Pedestrian Safety Unit and the Forensic Services Unit are trying to learn the cause and circumstances of the crash. Anybody with information can call 651-266-5722.
