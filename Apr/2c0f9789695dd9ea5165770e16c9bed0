The Gophers football team's practice Saturday will be open to the public. It starts at 11:15 a.m. at the team's indoor facility in the Athletes Village. The Gophers also announced that their future game at California, originally scheduled for 2029, has been moved to Sept. 13, 2025. The Gophers were scheduled to play Brigham Young that day, but that game was scratched. Cal will visit the Gophers at Huntington Bank Stadium in 2028. Minnesota no longer has BYU on its future schedule. The scheduled 2020 game between the Cougars and Gophers was canceled because of the pandemic, as the Gophers only played Big Ten opponents that year.

In addition, Gophers defenseman Ben Brinkman, who entered the portal earlier this week, is transferring to Notre Dame. •  Union named Josh Hauge as its coach.
