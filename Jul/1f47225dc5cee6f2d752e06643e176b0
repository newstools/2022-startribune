LOS ANGELES  — Major League Baseball's Midsummer Classic remains the most-watched all-star game in the major professional sports, even though it drew record lows in viewership for the fifth time since 2015. Tuesday night's game from Los Angeles — which the American League won 3-2 — averaged 7.51 million viewers on Fox, according to Nielsen, a decline of 9.7% from last year's contest in Colorado. The audience peaked at 8.24 million between 9:15 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. EDT. The game was the most-watched program on television Tuesday night and outdrew the three other major all-star games that were played in February. The NFL's Pro Bowl averaged 6.69 million on ABC, followed by the all-star games for the NBA (6.28 million on TNT/TBS) and NHL (1.15 million on ABC). The baseball game averaged 127,000 on Fox Deportes, giving it the second-highest audience for the event in Spanish-language television history. The game also averaged 107,455 on Fox Sports' streaming platforms. The Home Run Derby on Monday night on ESPN averaged 6.88 million, a 3.5% decrease from last year. ___ More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
