A boy's body was found in the trunk of a bloodied and damaged car Friday morning in Mound, and two people were arrested on suspicion of homicide, authorities said. Police had stopped the car at Shoreline Drive and Bartlett Boulevard in Mound. "Multiple scenes are being processed," read a statement from Orono police, who provide service to Mound and other nearby communities. In a media briefing Friday afternoon, Orono Police Chief Correy Farniok said the other locations are an apartment and a gas station on Three Points Boulevard. As of late Friday afternoon, the suspects remained in the custody of Orono police. According to a police statement, police were first alerted about 7:10 a.m. by a caller who reported a car driving on a tire rim with the back window smashed out. When officers stopped the car, which was being driven by a female, they noticed blood inside the vehicle and found the body inside the trunk. Police have yet to release details about the circumstances of the death. They also have not identified the people arrested or the person inside the trunk. "The case is still under investigation, however we believe that this is domestic-related and the victim is a juvenile male," a second statement from police read.
