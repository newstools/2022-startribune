Brooklyn Center police have arrested a man who reportedly confessed to firing more than 130 shots outside an apartment building while with his family July 4. The suspect, who lives in the building in the 5300 block of Russell Avenue N., on Thursday claimed responsibility for the shooting and cooperated with investigators, police said. Police said they found spent casings and "evidence that a shotgun was fired." Four firearms and dozens of rounds of ammunition also were found in a search of the suspect's apartment and car, police said.  The suspect, who had not yet been charged Friday afternoon, was arrested at the scene and taken to the Hennepin County jail. In a separate case, police responding to a reported shootout between two groups of people about 1 a.m. Wednesday recovered 75 spent casings in the parking lot of the Sonder House Apartments in the 5800 block of Xerxes Avenue N. The driver of a vehicle matching witnesses' descriptions fled the scene and was pursued by police before stopping in the 5600 block of East River Road in Fridley. The driver ran from the vehicle and had not been caught.   The gunfire damaged several apartments and vehicles. Investigators also found 25 spent casings at a nearby apartment complex on Northway Drive east of Xerxes Avenue N. No injuries were reported in the shootings at either location, police said.
