 The growth in farmers markets, both locally and nationally, has been on an upward trajectory for years. In 1985, the Twin Cities metro area had 20. By 2009, there were more than 50; today, the tally is well into the 60s. With so many markets from which to choose, why not set a goal of exploring some unfamiliar shopping territory? The beauty of markets is that no two are alike, and you never know what awaits. If you're on the go, map your market at strib.mn/3korIWQ.
