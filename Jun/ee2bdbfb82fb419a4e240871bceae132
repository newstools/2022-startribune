A worker was killed by electric shock while doing tree removal work near a power line in Fridley, authorities said Friday. The incident occurred about 8:25 p.m. Thursday among homes in the 5200 block of NE. Buchanan Street, the Anoka County Sheriff's Office said. The man, identified by the Sheriff's Office as Johnny Lee Coleman Cotton, 51, of Minneapolis, who was working for a private company. Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Tierney Peters said her agency is withholding the name of the company because "it is part of the investigative data." The company was removing a tree when the man in a lift struck a power line with a chainsaw and was electrocuted, according to the Sheriff's Office. The lift was lowered, and emergency responders tended to the man before he was declared dead at the scene.
