The skies above Minneapolis won't thunder with booms and twinkling colors this year. Because of staffing shortages and construction at Father Hennepin Park, the city won't hold its big fireworks show. But that doesn't mean there won't be places to get your fireworks fix during the July 4th weekend. Starting Saturday, there are dozens of displays taking place across the Twin Cities metro area and beyond. Pick your day, bring your blanket and don't forget the bug spray.
