Cory Hepola has left his WCCO radio show. Several news outlets are reporting that the former KARE-11 weekend anchor is contemplating to run in the Minnesota gubernatorial race. Media companies typically sever ties with employees who are seeking a political office. MPR News' Brian Bakst said Hepola is considering a third-party bid. Hepola's eponymous show, "Hey it's Cory Hepola," debuted on WCCO Radio in January 2019. The Minnesota native came to the station after nearly four years of co-hosting "KARE 11 News at Sunrise."  He hosted the 9 a.m.-noon slot previously held by John Hines. "Every experience, positive or negative, prepares us for what's next," Hepola tweeted Monday. "None of us are a finished product. but each day is a new opportunity to identify our special gifts and use them to uplift others. I knew from the start I'd do my best to accomplish that at WCCO...or so I thought. WCCO DID change my life, only in positive ways that I didn't expect. So today, I leave the iconic station with a heavy heart." A representative from Audacy, which owns WCCO, confirmed Hepola's departure, but had no further comment.
