Star Tribune columnist Patrick Reusse joins host Michael Rand for a look back at the weekend in sports, which included two stunning comebacks on Sunday: the Twins rallied from a 6-0 deficit in the eighth inning to defeat Kansas City 7-6, while Justin Thomas started the day seven shots off the lead but came back to win the PGA Championship in a playoff. Reusse still doesn't trust the Twins pitching, but he has to concede this is a pretty good team after a 25-16 start. Plus a look at the struggles of the Gophers baseball team, which finished 16-36 this season, and the surge of Andrew Wiggins in the playoffs for Golden State.
