 Taleen Rochelle Tana, 42, has been identified as the woman shot to death Tuesday in a camper in north Minneapolis, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said. Minneapolis police said the pickup-style camper was parked on Girard Avenue north of Plymouth Avenue when it was struck by gunfire from another vehicle just before 10 a.m. Police did not give a motive but said they do not believe the shooting was random. No arrests have been made, and police have asked for the public's help in finding the shooter. The victim and a man with her inside the camper "heard the gunshots," officer Garrett Parten, a police spokesman, said last week. "The female inside the RV felt the pain and realized she was shot, and they called 911 at that point." Tana's killing was the city's 43rd homicide of 2022.
