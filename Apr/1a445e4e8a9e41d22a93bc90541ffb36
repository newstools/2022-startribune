 One pandemic-era tradition that's worth keeping: outsourcing Easter dinner. Some of the best restaurants in the Twin Cities are offering take-and-bake meals, from kid-friendly treats and a multitude of egg-bake options to meals fit for Grandma's wedding china. Being able to carefully unwrap all the goodies instead of spending hours in the kitchen leaves more time for nibbling chocolate bunnies and hunting for that one last hidden egg.
