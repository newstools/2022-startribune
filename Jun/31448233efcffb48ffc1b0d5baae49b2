A 3-year-old boy was shot and critically wounded  in north Minneapolis on Sunday night. The shooting occurred near the intersection of Sheridan and 23rd Avenues North around 8:45 p.m. The child was rushed to North Memorial Health Hospital, where he underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Minneapolis police spokesman Garrett Parten said the child was listed in stable condition. No arrests have been made in the case. At the scene, crime tape enveloped a white house with a "Little Tikes" basketball hoop just outside the front steps. Investigators scoured the area for shell casings by flashlight late into the evening. They later recovered a handgun inside the residence, according to two sources with knowledge of the investigation. Authorities declined to confirm what evidence was collected or comment on the circumstances of the shooting. Early reports that the child had been playing outside at the time appear to be unfounded. The incident marks at least the eighth child 10-years-old and younger struck by gunfire in Minneapolis since last April — six of which occurred on the North Side. "I don't know how many times this can happen before the mayor and governor wake up," said Lisa Clemons, founder of the street outreach group A Mother's Love Initiative, whose members sat with the victim's family at the hospital Sunday night. "Kids are seeing too much violence before they ever enter school."      This is a breaking news story and will be updated.
