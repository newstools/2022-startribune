Lewis, of Minneapolis, died Wednesday at HCMC from injuries suffered about 12:30 a.m. Sunday in the 2900 block of S. 14th Avenue, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said. No arrests had been announced as of Friday afternoon. Officers responding to the shooting found Lewis down in the street, police said.
