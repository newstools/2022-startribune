BALTIMORE  — Federal prosecutors filed a superseding indictment on Thursday against Baltimore's top prosecutor stemming from charges that she made false statements on financial documents to take money from her retirement savings to purchase two Florida vacation homes. A brief statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office said the changes adds details that weren't in the  original indictment against Marilyn Mosby. Prosecutors said they would have no additional comment. On Jan. 13, a grand jury indicted Mosby on two counts each of perjury and making a false statement on a loan application in purchasing a home in Kissimmee, Florida, and a condominium in Long Boat Key, Florida. Mosby pleaded not guilty to the charges at her Feb. 4 arraignment. Her trial is expected to last four days. Prosecutors didn't seek Mosby's pretrial detention. Mosby, 41, was elected as Baltimore's state's attorney in 2014 and reelected in 2018. She received national acclaim in 2015 for bringing criminal charges against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, a Black man whose neck was broken in police custody. Gray's death sparked protests and riots. None of the officers was convicted. The indictment accuses Mosby of falsely stating that the COVID-19 pandemic harmed her finances so she could withdraw $90,000 from her city retirement account. Mosby's gross salary in 2020 was over $247,000 and never was reduced, the indictment says. Bolden has said that the state of Mosby's fledgling private businesses — Mahogany Elite Travel, Mahogany Elite Enterprises LLC and Mahogany Elite Consulting — allowed her to make the withdrawals. Mosby is married to Baltimore City Council President Nick Mosby, who has not been charged with any crimes.
