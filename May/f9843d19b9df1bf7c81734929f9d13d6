A look at some of the key business events and economic indicators upcoming this week: HOUSING MARKET BAROMETER The Commerce Department issues its April tally of new U.S. home sales Tuesday. Economists forecast that sales slowed again last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of around 750,000 homes. That would be the slowest sales pace since October and the fourth consecutive decline. Sharply higher borrowing costs are straining the limits of affordability for many would-be buyers. New home sales, seasonally adjusted annual rate, by month: Nov. 753,000 Dec. 871,000 Jan. 845,000 Feb. 835,000 March 763,000 April (est.) 750,000 Source: FactSet CLOSE-UP ON THE FED The Federal Reserve releases minutes from its most recent policymakers' meeting Wednesday. At the meeting earlier this month, the central bank intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark interest rate by a half-percentage point — its most aggressive move since 2000. The Fed's goal is to cool spending — and growth — by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow. A GOOD START?
