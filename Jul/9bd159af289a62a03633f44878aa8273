The field for the 3M Open took shape Friday, with 152 players in and four more to be determined in Monday's qualifier. Players can withdraw at any time from the tournament, which begins Thursday at the TPC Twin Cities in Blaine. Sahith Theegala, who is tied for eighth at the British Open, is in the field. The 24-year-old from Southern California shot 69 on Thursday and 68 on Friday at St. Andrews after only getting into the tournament when Daniel Berger withdrew last week. There are six major winners — Jason Day, Hideki Matsuyama, Stewart Cink, Jason Dufner, Danny Willett and Lucas Glover — playing in Blaine, along with former Players Championship winner Rickie Fowler, Tony Finau and nine-time PGA Tour winner Brandt Snedeker. Besides Theegala, other golfers in the 3M field who made the cut in Scotland include Christiaan Bezuidenhout, Cameron Tringale, Finau, Matusyama and Willett. Cameron Champ is the defending champion and Minnesota-born tennis star Mardy Fish got a sponsor's exemption to play. Monday's qualifier will be at Victory Links in Blaine. 3M OPEN FIELD Thursday-Sunday at TPC Twin Cities Kiradech Aphibarnrat Ryan Armour Arjun Atwal Aaron Baddeley Sangmoon Bae Paul Barjon Ricky Barnes Christiaan Bezuidenhout Jonas Blixt Joseph Bramlett Ryan Brehm Scott Brown Wesley Bryan Hayden Buckley Jonathan Byrd Greg Chalmers Cameron Champ Kevin Chappell Stewart Cink Wyndham Clark Austin Cook Ben Crane Joshua Creel Brian Davis Jason Day Brett Drewitt Jason Dufner Tyler Duncan Derek Ernst Tony Finau Mardy Fish Rickie Fowler Dylan Frittelli Tommy Gainey Brice Garnett Robert Garrigus Brian Gay Doug Ghim Michael Gligic Lucas Glover Fabián Gómez Chris Gotterup Lanto Griffin Emiliano Grillo Scott Gutschewski Bill Haas Chesson Hadley Adam Hadwin Brandon Hagy James Hahn Cole Hammer Nick Hardy David Hearn J.J.
