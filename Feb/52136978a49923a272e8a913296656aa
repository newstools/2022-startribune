The University of Minnesota won't be returning to the "Jeopardy" winner's circle. Sophomore Emmey Harris, who grew up in Lincoln, Neb., was eliminated from the game show's college championship in an episode that aired Friday in prime-time television. She came in third during a semi-final round — but only lost by $400 in a nail-biting, all-female round. Fellow Gopher Nabir Sarma won the title in 2020, the last time the contest took place. Students from the University of Minnesota also got as far as the semi-finals in 1994, 1995 and 2010. The finals, which will feature students from the University of Texas, Northeastern College and Kennesaw State University, airs at 7 p.m. Tuesday on KSTP, Ch. 5
