Wolves update: Minnesota plays Dallas, which it trails in the Western Conference standings by 1½ games, twice within the next week. The teams will follow Monday's matchup in Dallas with a date at Target Center on Friday. The Wolves, who have clinched a play-in spot at the least, have won 10 of 11. Center Karl-Anthony Towns played in Saturday's victory over Milwaukee despite having a right forearm contusion that nearly kept him out. Towns is again listed as questionable. Naz Reid (back spasms) is listed as probable; he played Saturday as well. Mavericks update: Luka Doncic missed both matchups the teams played earlier in the season. Doncic, averaging 28.1 points, 9.2 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game, is fourth in the league with 28.1 points per game. ... Dallas has the sixth-best defensive rating in the league at 108.5 points allowed per 100 possessions. Since joining the Mavericks in a trade with the Wizards, Spencer Dinwiddie is averaging 17.5 points per game and is shooting 40% from three-point range.
