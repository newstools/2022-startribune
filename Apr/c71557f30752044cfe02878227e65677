The Twins' weekend sweep of the White Sox vaulted them into first place in the not-so-impressive-so-far American League Central with an 8-8 record. Next is a three-game series against the Tigers, which starts tonight (6:40, BSN-Extra) at Target Field. Chris Paddack (0-2, 5.00) pitches for the Twins against Detroit lefthander Eduardo Rodriguez (0-1, 5.27). Byron Buxton stays at DH, with Gilberto Celestino playing center for the Twins. Against the lefthander Rodriguez, the Twins are using an all-righthanded hitting lineup except for RF Max Kepler. Catcher Gary Sanchez (abdominal issue) remains sidelined for the Twins, although he has not been placed on the injured list. Manager Rocco Baldelli said Sanchez will ramp up his activity level Wednesday to test the injury.
