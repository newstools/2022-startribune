The Las Vegas Strip has been turned into NFL Central this weekend, a sea of 32 teams' colors as the site of the 2022 draft. Time will tell whose gambles pay off but for now, all 32 first-round picks are sure bets in the minds of those who picked them. Here's a look at Thursday night's opening round. Travon Walker, 6-5, 272-pound defensive end, Georgia: Rugged run-stopper with explosiveness and aggression that sets the edge and will be dominant at the next level. Aidan Hutchinson, 6-7, 260-pound defensive end, Michigan: Hometown kid stays home. Will immediately help a Detroit team that was 31st in third-down defense and 30th in sacks. Derek Stingley Jr., 6-foot, 190-pound cornerback, LSU: Possesses a blend of size and speed but played in just 10 games over the past two years, offering flashes of upside rather than sustained play. Sauce Gardner, 6-3, 190-pound cornerback, Cincinnati: Did not allow a receiving touchdown during his three-year career with the Bearcats, which leads to desired confidence. Kayvon Thibodeaux, 6-4, 254-pound defensive end, Oregon: Long, strong and explosive. He has pro-ready attributes with heavy hands and a closing kick to the quarterback (115 QB pressures from 2019-21). Ickey Ekwonu, 6-4, 310-pound offensive tackle, N.C. State: Familiar name and first-team all-America gets his chance in the pros in his backyard. Allowed just 10 sacks in 31 career college games (1,256 pass-block snaps). Evan Neal, 6-7, 337-pound offensive tackle, Alabama: Quick feet and moves (executed a 48-inch box jump) for a player of his size. Started games at left tackle, right tackle and guard for the Crimson Tide. Drake London, 6-4, 219-pound wide receiver, USC: A go-getter with off-the-charts ball possession rates and catch radius. Has a basketball background that allows him to rise up over defenders. Charles Cross, 6-5, 307-pound offensive tackle, Mississippi State: Limited starting experience, but played with a high level of consistency. He neutralized power rushers and is above average as a drive blocker. Garrett Wilson, 6-foot, 183-pound wide receiver, Ohio State: Eye-popping ball skills with run-after-catch ability. Career-high 70 catches for 1,078 yards with 12 TDs last season. Chris Olave, 6-foot, 187-pound wide receiver, Ohio State: Smooth and steady, Olave is a fluid and easy receiver from snap to the catch and all points between. Has 35 career TDs, most in Buckeyes history. Jameson Williams, 6-1, 179-pound wide receiver, Alabama: Detroit moved up 20 spots to grab a dynamic route-runner with electric long speed. Suffered ACL injury but had four TDs of 70 or more yards last season. Jordan Davis, 6-6, 341-pound defensive tackle, Georgia: A mountainous presence with the size, power and will to clog the line. Also ran a 4.78-second 40-yard dash at the combine. Named the nation's top defensive player. Kyle Hamilton, 6-4, 220-pound safety, Notre Dame: Has the eyes and speed to play over the top, strength and toughness to play near the line and coverage length to guard pass-catching tight ends. Kenyon Green, 6-4, 323-pound guard, Texas A&M: Possesses adequate foot quickness to operate in a variety of run schemes. Has a broad frame with good thickness from waist to ankles. Jahan Dotson, 5-11, 178-pound wide receiver, Penn State: Finesse wideout with speed and athleticism who is fully operational on all three levels. Hauled in 91 catches for 1,182 yards and 12 TDs last season. Zion Johnson, 6-3, 312-pound guard, Boston College: Has a wide frame and immense playing power and shines as a double-team blocker. A two-time captain with intelligence to match. Treylon Burks, 6-2, 225-pound wide receiver, Arkansas: Tennessee traded A.J. Brown to the Eagles as part of this pick and in Burks it gets an all-SEC selection who set a school record with six 100-yard receiving games. Trevor Penning, 6-7, 325-pound offensive tackle, Northern Iowa: Three-year starter at left tackle with outstanding measurables. Plays with a bit of nastiness and seeks out violent block finishes when possible. Kenny Pickett, 6-3, 217-pound quarterback, Pitt: The first quarterback off the board is a Heisman Trophy finalist who has five years of game experience and four years of starting experience. A pocket passer with good mobility, he threw 42 TDs with just seven INTs. Trent McDuffie, 5-11, 193-pound cornerback, Washington: Three-year starter whose average size is overshadowed by ruggedness, allowing him to contest throws from a variety of coverages. Quay Walker, 6-4, 241-pound linebacker, Georgia: Features lateral quickness with size and speed. Plays in space with a second gear on the blitz. Started all 15 games with 67 tackles, 5 1⁄2 for loss. Kaiir Elam, 6-1, 191-pound cornerback, Florida: Missed three games with a knee injury last season but still started 10 games. Did not produce the interception numbers but is patient and strong. Tyler Smith, 6-5, 324-pound offensive tackle, Tulsa: A sure need for Dallas, Smith brings tenacity and aggression to displace defenders. Played the final 12 games of the season at left tackle. Tyler Linderbaum, 6-2, 296-pound center, Iowa: Quick and nasty with a wrestling background, considered the best center in the draft. Plays with leverage and body control to sustain and keep running lanes open. Jermaine Johnson, 6-5, 254-pound defensive end, Florida State: Eden Prairie product was thought to go higher in the draft but slipped. Long, physical and aggressive. Made 70 tackles with 12 sacks. Devin Lloyd, 6-3, 237-pound linebacker, Utah: Has a stat sheet full of production in every category, including 43 tackles for loss over the past three seasons. Talented as a rusher either blitzing or aligning off the edge. Devonte Wyatt, 6-3, 304-pound defensive tackle, Georgia: He should fit as a rotational, gap-seeking three-technique with disruptive flashes. Shows urgency in locating a pass blocker's edge. Cole Strange, 6-5, 307-pound guard, UT-Chattanooga: What he lacks in strength he makes up for in lateral quickness. Also has experience snapping the ball and could provide flexibility at center. George Karlaftis, 6-4, 266-pound guard, Purdue: Broad hips and strong hands, Karlaftis will play with persistence and energy. Motor never stops. Needs more development but plays strong on the edge. Daxton Hill, 6-foot, 191-pound safety, Michigan: Smooth off the ball on his backpedal, he has a versatility for multiple coverages. Has a quick trigger to close downhill. Best in the slot to torment opposing QBs. Lewis Cine, 6-2, 199-pound safety, Georgia: The fifth Bulldogs defensive player taken is an aggressive talent who plays with an urgent, downhill approach. Fast through the ally he can galvanize a defense with his hitting. Information compiled from the Associated Press and NFL.com was used in this report.
