Director Joel Sass did part of my job at Open Eye Theatre's "Hair Ball! A Bigfoot Musical Adventure" when he called the show "a live-action comic book musical." That's an apt description of the world premiere, which Open Eye is staging on the green roof of Minneapolis' Bakken Museum. Here are a few more observations on what to expect: 'Hair Ball! A Bigfoot Musical Adventure' Who: By Josef Evans. Directed by Joel Sass. When: 7 p.m. Wed., Fri., Sun. Ends June 19. Where: Bakken Museum rooftop, 3537 Zenith Av. S., Mpls. Protocol: Masks are optional. Tickets: $30, 612-874-6338 or openeyetheatre.org.
