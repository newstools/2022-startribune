PALM BEACH, FLA. – While Kevin O'Connell attends seminars and catches up with his counterparts in his first NFL annual meetings as Vikings coach, the team made a couple of additions for his roster. The Vikings signed former Dolphins guard Jesse Davis and former Broncos cornerback Nate Hairston on Monday. Both players spent the day at the team's headquarters, the TCO Performance Center in Eagan. Davis, who turns 31 in September, has started 72 games at either guard or tackle the past five seasons in Miami. He had signed a three-year, $15 million contract extension with the Dolphins at the beginning of the 2019 season, but the team released him Thursday. The 6-6, 320-pounder is now the favorite to start at right guard for the Vikings. Hairston played 16 games for the Broncos last year, starting once while playing for new Vikings defensive coordinator Ed Donatell; 241 of his 389 snaps were on special teams. He made 17 starts in his first three NFL seasons with the Colts and Jets. The Vikings also re-signed cornerback Tye Smith. He played in five games last season. Cornerback Chandon Sullivan, who signed a one-year deal with the Vikings last week, will make $1.75 million in 2022, with the potential to earn up to $660,000 in incentives. Sullivan's deal includes a $665,000 bonus to go with a league-minimum $1.035 million base salary and a $50,000 offseason workout bonus. His incentives, which are based on playing time and his number of interceptions in 2022, are also tied to the Vikings showing improvement on their performance in 2021.
