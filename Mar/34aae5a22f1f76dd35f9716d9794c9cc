After a fleeting warm-up late last week, Saturday night's mix of snow and ice has prompted Minneapolis to declare a snow emergency, meaning parking restrictions begin Sunday at 9 p.m. In a press release, city spokeswoman Sarah Mackenzie encourages residents to move their vehicles so crews can plow more than 1,000 miles of street "as wide as possible." If you need a mental image, Mackenzie offers this: "That's the equivalent of 3,200 'lane miles' of streets that need to be plowed—enough to plow a lane from Minneapolis to Anchorage, Alaska." The good news is that some of the plows have fun little names now. Here are the rules for parking over the next few days: Sunday, March 6, 9 p.m. to 8 a.m. Monday, March 7 (Day 1) Do not park on EITHER side of a Snow Emergency route until 8 a.m., or the street is fully plowed. Monday, March 7, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Day 2)  Do not park on the EVEN numbered side of a non-Snow Emergency route until 8 p.m., or until that side of the street is fully plowed, or on EITHER side of a parkway until 8 p.m., or the parkway is fully plowed. Tuesday, March 8, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Day 3) Do not park on the ODD numbered side of a non-Snow Emergency route until 8 p.m., or that side of the street is fully plowed.
