A 14-year-old Duluth boy is in custody in connection with the death of a 19-year-old family member Friday night. According to a Duluth Police Departmen news release, officers responded to a medical call in the 1700 block of East Superior Street and found a 19-year-old woman injured and unresponsive. Medical responders pronounced the woman dead at the scene. After further investigation, officers apprehended the 14-year-old after he was "determined to be involved," the news release said. He is being held on suspicion of second-degree murder at the Arrowhead Juvenile Center pending formal charges by the St. Louis County Attorney's Office. Officers had been at the same address earlier Friday evening, police reported. They had responded to a call of a disturbance, and an adult male member of the same family was alleged to have been assaulted. Police spoke to the man, determined there'd been no assault and left the scene. No further information was released, including the victim's name. Police say they continue to investigate what happened.
