The forecast looks bright for Eric Ahasic. The Minneapolis meteorologist is on a four-day winning streak on "Jeopardy," collecting more than $105,000 in the process. His week got off to an impressive start when he defeated Ryan Long, who had won 16 times in a row, earning nearly $300,000. Ahasic, who works for the National Weather Service in Chanhassen, will try to keep going when his latest round airs at 4:30 p.m. Friday on KARE 11. His "Jeopardy" appearances were taped in April. He has a long way to go before he threatens Ken Jennings' record of 74 consecutive victories. During his short chat with host Mayim Bialik on Wednesday, Ahasic gave a shout-out to Live Cat Tours in his Wedge neighborhood.
