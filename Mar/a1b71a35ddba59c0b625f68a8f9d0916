There will be glitter at a welcome home community celebration for Minnesota cross-country skiing star Jessie Diggins. The event called "All That Glitters, is Jessie Diggins,"  will honor the Afton resident who frequently wears glitter on her face when she is competing, including at the 2022 Winter Olympics in China, where she won historic bronze and silver medals. The public is invited to join the celebration from noon to 5 p.m. April 2 at Town Square Park in Afton, at the south end of the Historic Village on the west side of St. Croix Trail S. and between Upper 34th and 34th streets S. Diggins will arrive at 1 p.m. to talk, pose for photos and display her Olympic medals and World Cup trophies. There will be glitter, raffle items from sponsor Salomon, posters, T-shirts and Diggins' autobiography, "Brave Enough," available for purchase. There also will be a heated tent, food trucks and Selma's Ice Cream will be selling a commemorative sundae with edible glitter sprinkles. Parking is limited, so carpooling is suggested.
