Introduction: Host Michael Rand listened (and listened again) to new Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell's introductory news conference and picked out what he deems the five most important things from what was said. You'll hear audio clips from those five moments — including O'Connell's thoughts on Kirk Cousins, his defensive philosophy and that ever-important "collaboration" — along with why Rand thinks they are so important. 15:00: Rand caught up with Tom Craft, who recruited O'Connell and was his head coach at San Diego State in the mid-2000s. Craft gives perspectives on O'Connell's personality and why he thinks O'Connell will succeed as a head coach. 22:00: Jim Harbaugh shockingly got a contract extension and raise from Michigan after his flirtation with the Vikings ... the Gophers basketball teams had a pair of ugly losses, but the hockey team got a big recruit ... and La Velle E. Neal III checked in from Beijing with an Olympic dispatch. Listen and subscribe to the Daily Delivery: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Podcasts | iHeartRadio The podcast archive is here. Questions?
