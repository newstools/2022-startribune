If you read Packers QB Aaron Rodgers' most recent social media post as isolated and heartfelt, then it is no more than a man taking stock of his life and expressing gratitude for the good things that have happened in the last year.

As I talked about on Tuesday's Daily Delivery podcast, this all seems like part of a pattern of attention-seeking behavior (Rodgers, not the podcast). Remember, it was the night of the NFL Draft last year when word leaked that Rodgers was unhappy in Green Bay. Maybe that was beyond Rodgers' control. Maybe he wasn't the source. But the saga endured for months, culminating with a season in which Rodgers: So that's where we are now, seeing as how this is late February. Because Rodgers has some leverage this time around ... and because he has said he will make a decision soon ... and because his future is very much tied to that of free agent receiver Davante Adams ... this saga figures to be resolved more quickly. But not before Rodgers wedged his way back into another news cycle. Rodgers might eventually say he was merely expressing himself on social media, but he's smart and calculating. He knew his words would be parsed. There are other less public ways to express gratitude for the people in your life. Like, say, with some phone calls or text messages. He wanted the attention. It worked, even if the message here is simple: Ignore it.
