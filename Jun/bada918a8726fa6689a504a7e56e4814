Alex Kirilloff homered in the leadoff spot for the second straight game, and the St. Paul Saints completed a six-game sweep of the Rochester Red Wings with a 5-1 victory Sunday at CHS Field in St. Paul. The six-game sweep was a first at home for the Saints (30-29), who have now homered in 17 consecutive games. Kirilloff and Jermaine Palacios each had two RBI as the Saints tied a franchise record with their seventh consecutive victory. Jake Faria retired eight Rochester (35-25) hitters in a row from the second through fourth innings before walking Taylor Gushue. It was the only walk Faria (1-2) allowed. He struck out two and gave up one run on five hits in five innings pitched. Hunter Wood, JC Ramirez, Drew Strotman and Yennier Cano each pitched a scoreless inning of relief. The Saints are back in action at 6 p.m. Tuesday as they take on the Columbus Clippers at Huntington Park in Ohio.
