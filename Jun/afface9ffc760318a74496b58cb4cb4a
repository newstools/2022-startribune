Gate E (southwest side of the stadium) will open to attendees at 11:15 a.m., and the service will start at 12 p.m. It is expected to last 90 minutes.

Memorial contributions can be made to the Marion S. Barber III Scholarship, and the fund will provide scholarships for CEHD undergraduates with financial need. Preference will be given to students who support the University's mission of creating a diverse and inclusive student body, including those with underrepresented identities or who have overcome obstacles and challenges to achieve their educational goals. People can support the scholarship by sending a check to the UM Foundation, P.O.
