A 34-year-old Minneapolis man was charged Tuesday in Cass County District Court with fatally stabbing a 19-year-old in the chest after an argument last weekend outside a home in north-central Minnesota.  Floyd R. Desjarlais was accused of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter in the killing Saturday night at a home in Pike Bay Township, near Cass Lake. Desjarlais remained jailed in lieu of $350,000 bail and was scheduled to return to court Monday. Court records did not list an attorney for him. Authorities have not released the victim's identity. According to the criminal complaint: The owner of the home in the 16100 block of Waboose Trail said he was the victim's  grandfather and that  Desjarlais wanted to "fight all of us." He said the suspect and his grandson were drinking and arguing in a back room. Officers took Desjarlais from the home to a hospital to be treated for injuries. He denied  doing anything wrong and told authorities, "I got jumped." The victim was stabbed in the chest, head and two fingers, and suffered bruises to his abdomen, arm, hands, legs and liver, according to the Ramsey County Medical Examiner's Office. Desjarlais' criminal history in Minnesota includes convictions for assault from 2007 to 2014.
