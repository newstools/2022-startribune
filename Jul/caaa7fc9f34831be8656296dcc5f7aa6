A 19-year-old man has been sentenced to prison after admitting in court to fatally shooting a man in an Austin, Minn., home as part of a plot to steal drugs. Miguel A. Nunez Jr. of Sioux Falls, S.D., pleaded guilty Monday in Mower County District Court to second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of David Harris, 45, and wounding of second person on June 5, 2021. County Attorney Kristen Nelsen said Wednesday that under a plea agreement, Nunez should receive a 15-year sentence and with credit for time in jail since his arrest is expected to serve about nine years in prison. The remainder will be served on supervised release.  Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 27. The person wounded in the encounter said Nunez and three others arrived about 1 a.m. at Harris' home in the 100 block of NE. 12th Street to buy marijuana. But according to charges, Nunez drew a gun and demanded all of the drugs or "he would shoot everyone in the house." When Harris countered with his own gun, Nunez shot him three times in the chest, the criminal complaint. Nunez then shot the second person as they struggled. According to the charges, Harris managed to fire one shot that wounded Nunez, possibly in the hand.
