Authorities have identified the driver who died last week in a rollover crash in south Minneapolis. Clemente Garcia, 20, of Minneapolis, died shortly before 8 a.m. Wednesday at HCMC after crashing his vehicle in the 4200 block of S. Nicollet Avenue, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office reported. Police said Garcia rolled his vehicle about 2:45 a.m. that same day and ended up pinned underneath it unconscious. Officers, firefighters and HCMC emergency responders worked together to lift the vehicle and pull out the injured man, said Garrett Parten, a police spokesman, in a statement Monday. The impact of the crash damaged a concrete barrier, a chain-link fence and a retaining wall, Parten said.
