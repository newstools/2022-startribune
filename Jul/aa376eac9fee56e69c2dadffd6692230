Four years after his son Joaquin was shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, Manuel Oliver's pain is still raw. Right or wrong, he took his personal fight to the White House lawn on Monday. On national television, Oliver rudely interrupted President Joe Biden during an event meant to celebrate what many consider a bipartisan, but watered-down, law to reduce gun violence. "Today is many things. It's proof that despite the naysayers, we can make meaningful progress in dealing with gun violence. Because make no mistake …" Biden was saying when Oliver jumped up from his chair on the lawn. "We have to do more than that!" Oliver yelled from the audience, startling guests and the president. Television footage shows Oliver standing and shouting at Biden, who briefly turned into "tough Joe" and ordered Oliver to "Sit down, you'll hear what I have to say. ... Let me finish my comments." Oliver, who has become a well-known gun control activist in Florida, was approached by security, then escorted out. Was he disrespectful? Yes. But was his behavior totally understandable? Yes, too. Oliver's outburst makes clear that no Minnie Mouse legislation will be enough until we do away with assault weapons. We, and every lawmaker, must be reminded of that daily — and sometimes rudely. Oliver is right, but what the president was trying to bring home is that in this arduous battle, small victories must be acknowledged. Oliver is not the first Parkland parent to stage the disruption of a national event. In 2020, Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was also killed at Parkland, was a guest of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when he disrupted then-President Donald Trump's State of the Union address. Oliver's heart-wrenching outburst reminded us of the horror of Parkland. Yes, four years on, many of us have moved on. And for that, we're to blame.
