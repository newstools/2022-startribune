The Gophers men's basketball team will compete in the SoCal Challenge during Thanksgiving week for the 2022-23 season, event organizers announced Tuesday. The eight-team event in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., is scheduled for November 21 and 23 with two divisions. The Surf Division features the Gophers, UNLV, Southern Illinois, and Cal Baptist, while the Sand Division features Cal State Northridge, Central Michigan, Tennessee State, and High Point. High Point is coached by G.G. Smith, the son of former Gophers coach Tubby Smith, who retired after coaching his alma mater last season. Last season, the inaugural SoCal Challenge was won by Fresno State and Utah Valley in their respective divisions. The Gophers are expected to host Central Michigan on Nov. 18 at Williams Arena as part of the multi-team event. The season opener is Nov. 11 vs. St. Francis-Brooklyn at the Barn. Second-year Gophers coach Ben Johnson will have a nearly revamped roster after finishing 13-17 in his first season with his alma mater, but he returns leading scorer and rebounder Jamison Battle. Part of the incoming newcomers is North Carolina transfer Dawson Garcia. "We're looking forward to playing in the SoCal Challenge and facing some great competition Thanksgiving week," Johnson said in the news release. "We know our student-athletes will have a first-class experience at such a well-run national tournament. I'm excited for our Gophers fans to experience a fun, warm destination that they can travel to and enjoy."
