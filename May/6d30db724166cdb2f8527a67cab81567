"You don't stop the rock," goes the classic song by New York's Sugarhill Gang. Art-A-Whirl agrees. After a two-year hiatus, the rock 'n' roll side of northeast Minneapolis' sprawling three-day studio and pub crawl is back with a vengeance — and with some of the Furious Five, too. Northeast live music hub the 331 Club and neighboring eatery the Sheridan Room are bringing in a posse of hip-hop legends to their outdoor Art-A-Whirl bash: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Melle Mel and Scorpio of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five will join fellow New York pioneers the Sugarhill Gang of "Rapper's Delight" outside the 331 on Saturday night. The same group was booked to perform the event in 2020. "That didn't happen, of course, so they agreed to come and perform this year," said 331 co-owner Jarret Oulman. Those aren't the only hip-hop vets booked at Art-A-Whirl parties: Pryes Brewing has Chali 2na of '90s Los Angeles group Jurassic 5 scheduled at the same time as the New Yorkers. Eastside Food Co-op is hosting its first-ever bash Saturday afternoon with local reggae vet Innocent and indie rockers Little Fevers. Conversely, a couple of Art-A-Whirl mainstays opted not to host music this year, Grumpy's Bar and the Anchor Fish & Chips (though both will be open as usual). Some of the neighborhood's many breweries — which took over the Art-A-Whirl party scene over the past decade — have music on tap all weekend, including Bauhaus, 612 and Indeed, which brings back its outdoor Whirlygig party Friday through Sunday. "We're highlighting a bunch of local bands that we think are awesome and that, since COVID, haven't had as many opportunities to play," said Indeed sales director Ryan Bandy. As always, navigating Art-A-Whirl's live music offerings around Northeast can quite truly be a whirl. Here's an hour-by-hour guide with our favorite pick plus a backup option.
