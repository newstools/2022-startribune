A driver heading the wrong way on Interstate 394 collided head-on with another motorist early Friday near the Ridgedale Mall in Minnetonka, the State Patrol said. The driver of the car that was struck died in the crash, the patrol said. The eastbound lanes of I-394 have been closed since the wreck at the Plymouth Road exit, which happened at about 4 a.m., and will remain closed until further notice, the patrol said. Commuters can get around the closure by diverting to Hwy. 7, Crosstown Hwy. 62, Hwy. 55 or using city streets. Preliminary information indicates the driver of a Jeep Wrangler entered the eastbound lanes of I-394 at 6th Street in downtown Minneapolis. The Jeep driver,  a 20-year-old from St. Paul, then drove west before colliding with an eastbound Chrysler Sebring, the patrol said. The Jeep driver, who was wearing a seat belt, was taken to North Memorial Health with noncritical injuries, the patrol said. The driver of the Sebring, a 30-year-old man from Melrose, Minn., was killed in the crash. His name has not been released. A 21-year-old woman who was a passenger in his vehicle was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center with noncritical injuries, the patrol said. Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the crash, the patrol said.
