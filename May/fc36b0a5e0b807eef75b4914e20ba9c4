LOUISVILLE, KY. — The Kentucky Derby is always a pageant of equine beauty, featuring some of the best-looking thoroughbreds on the planet. Before arriving in Louisville on Wednesday, a group of Derby-bound Minnesotans got an appetizer. Friends of Barry and Joni Butzow, whose colt Zozos will run in the Derby on Saturday, spent the early part of the week visiting horse farms in the Lexington area. They saw both of Zozos' parents. His mother, Papa's Forest, lives at Woodline Farm near Paris, Ky. Zozos' father, Munnings, is among the premier stallions at Coolmore America/Ashford Stud, a palatial complex near the Kentucky town of Versailles. The staff at Coolmore America brought out a few of their top stallions for the group to view. Among the highlights:   The most impressive horse on Tuesday's tours might have been Medaglia d'Oro. He's the flagship sire at Jonabell Farm, home to the U.S.-based stallions of Darley Stud, owned by Sheikh Mohammed, ruler of Dubai. Medaglia d'Oro looks far younger than his 23 years and appeared to be the king of the barn, shared with fellow luminaries Street Sense, Nyquist and Essential Quality. Back at Churchill Downs, the two Minnesota-owned Derby horses, Zandon and Zozos, each galloped a mile and a half Wednesday and continue to thrive.
