A driver heading the wrong way on Interstate 394 collided head-on with another vehicle and killed the other motorist before dawn Friday near the Ridgedale Mall in Minnetonka, the State Patrol said. Joseph P. Maness, 20, of St. Anthony, was booked into the Hennepin County jail later in the morning and awaits possibly being charged with criminal vehicular homicide. Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the crash, the patrol said. The driver who died, a 30-year-old man from Melrose, Minn., has yet to be identified. According to the patrol: Maness started heading west in his SUV on eastbound I-394 at 6th Street in downtown Minneapolis before colliding with  the Melrose man's eastbound car, the patrol said. Maness was treated for injuries and then jailed shortly before 8:30 a.m. A 21-year-old woman in the car, Neyvia Irias, was taken to HCMC with noncritical injuries, the patrol said. The eastbound lanes of I-394 near the crash were closed for three hours Friday morning.
