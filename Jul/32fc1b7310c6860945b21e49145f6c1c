Authorities have identified the three Twin Cities family members who died when their SUV was crushed between two semitrailer trucks in a construction zone on an interstate in Moorhead where another multivehicle crash occurred a day earlier. The crash occurred about 2 p.m. Friday on westbound Interstate 94, roughly 2 miles from Minnesota's border with North Dakota, the State Patrol said. Killed in the SUV were driver Robert C. Correll, 65, and passenger Linda M. Correll, 65, both of Ham Lake, and passenger Shirley A. Gatkze, 89, of Blaine, the patrol said. The driver's brother said that the Corrells were husband and wife for 44 years, and Gatzke was Linda Correll's mother. The patrol said that a semi being driven by Kenneth L. Jarvis, 58, of Wells, Minn., was stopped in the construction zone, as was the SUV. A second semi kept moving, hit the SUV from behind and sent it into the rear of the semi in front. The semi that didn't stop was driven by 49-year-old Maxim Rubin. The patrol said it did not have a city of residence for Rubin. His truck's marking showed it was operated by Penner International, based in Steinbach, Manitoba. Neither semi driver was hurt. There was another multivehicle crash just a day earlier in the same construction zone, said Patrol Sgt. Jesse Grabow. That chain-reaction wreck involving four vehicles — a semi, two SUVs and a car — occurred about 2 miles to the east on I-94 and left four people injured. The most seriously hurt was 70-year-old Marjorie E. Eggert, of Valley City, N.D.  Eggert, who was driving an SUV at the time, was last reported to be receiving treatment in a Moorhead hospital for life-threatening injuries.
