Both directions of Hwy. 65 in Blaine have reopened following a crash early Monday that left a woman dead. Authorities closed the highway for several hours after a semitrailer truck and an SUV collided near 109th Avenue and Hwy. 65 about 4:30 a.m., the Anoka County Sheriff's Office said. The highway was shut down between 105th Avenue NE. and 117th Avenue NE. for most of the morning rush hour, causing long traffic jams in the southbound lanes, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) said. Preliminary information indicates the semitrailer truck was traveling south on Hwy. 65 when it struck the SUV, which was traveling east on 109th Avenue. A 51-year-old Coon Rapids woman in the SUV was declared dead at the scene, the State Patrol said. The victim's name has not been released. The truck driver, a man, sustained minor injuries, the patrol said. An image from a MnDOT camera showed the truck's trailer in the center median. The SUV appeared to have skidded through the median, crossed the northbound lanes and come to a stop in the ditch on the right side of the highway. Emergency vehicles from several agencies were sent to the scene.
