Shimmy Gray-Miller has been promoted associate head coach of the University of Minnesota women's basketball team. Head coach Lindsay Whalen made the announcement through a release. "With over 20 years of experience at the Division I level, her vast knowledge of the game is extremely valuable to our program,'' Whalen said. Gray-Miller is entering her second year with the program. Hired as an assistant coach prior to the 2021-22 season, she works with post players, sets up recruiting visits for the program and helps prepare scouting reports. In 20 years of coaching, Gray-Miller has worked with programs in all of the Power Five  conferences, most recently at Clemson. Gray-Miller assumes the associate head coaching position formerly held by Carly Thibault-DuDonis, who left Minnesota to accept the head coaching job of the Fairfield University women's team.
