Hopkins' 5-11 guard Amaya Battle was named Miss Basketball, the Minnesota Girls Basketball Coaches Association announced on Saturday. The honor is awarded to the state's top senior player. Battle, who is a part of the Gophers' top 10 nationally ranked recruiting class, will join the program this summer. She is the sister of Jamison Battle, who plays for the Gophers men's team, and is ranked the nation's No. 11 point guard by ESPN/Hoop Gurlz Basketball. She had nine points and six assists and was a team-high plus-22 for the Royals (28-1) in their 72-56 win over St. Michael-Albertville last month in the Class 4A state championship game. Megan Dray hit a two-out two-run homer and Sara Kinch, the next batter, a solo shot in the top of the eighth inning as the Gophers softball team beat Iowa  5-2  in Iowa City. Dray also had an RBI single in the second and Kinch an RBI double that inning. Autumn Pease pitched the final 3-2/3 innings for Minnesota (17-15-1, 4-4 Big Ten) to get the win. She held the Hawkeyes (18-17,  1-7) scoreless, giving up only one hit, striking out two and walking none. The Gophers baseball team lost 5-4 to No. 23 Maryland at Siebert Field.
