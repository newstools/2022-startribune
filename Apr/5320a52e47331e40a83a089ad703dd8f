A man has died more than two weeks after crashing his vehicle in the middle of the night in Bloomington, officials said. Michael A. Boisjolie, 41, of Minneapolis, died April 20 from injuries he suffered in the rollover wreck on April 4, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office. Police said they located an unconscious Boisjolie, pinned in the upside-down wreckage about 3:40 a.m. near W. 78th Street and Computer Avenue. Emergency responders got him out of the vehicle and took him to HCMC, where he died. "It is believed that speed is a contributing factor to the crash," said Deputy Police Chief Kimberly Clauson.
