A look at some of the key business events and economic indicators upcoming this week: CONFIDENCE WANING? The Conference Board delivers its latest monthly index of U.S. consumer confidence Tuesday. Economists project the index, which takes into account consumers' assessment of current conditions and the outlook for the future, declined to 109.5 this month from a reading of 113.8 in January. A reading of 90 or better reflects a healthy economy, suggesting consumer confidence remains high despite surging inflation. Consumer confidence, by month: Sept. 109.8 Oct. 111.6 Nov. 111.9 Dec. 115.2 Jan. 113.8 Feb.

Analysts predict the home improvement chain will report Wednesday that its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue increased from a year earlier. That would match the retailer's results in the previous three quarters. Lowe's has benefited from strong sales growth as the hot housing market leads many homeowners to remodel. HOUSING MARKET BELLWETHER The Commerce Department issues its January tally of new U.S. home sales Thursday. Economists forecast that sales slowed last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 780,000 homes. That would follow a sales rate of 811,000 homes in December. That surge in December marked the fastest rate in 10 months as buyers snapped up cheaper homes in anticipation of higher interest rates. New home sales, seasonally adjusted annual rate, by month: Aug. 668,000 Sept. 725,000 Oct. 649,000 Nov. 725,000 Dec. 811,000 Jan. (est.) 780,000 Source: FactSet
