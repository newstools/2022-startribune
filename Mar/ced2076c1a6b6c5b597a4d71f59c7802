A 27-year-old man was charged Tuesday in the St. Paul shooting death last week of a 31-year-old man whose brother was shot to death in 2019. Delaquay L. Williams of St. Paul was charged in Ramsey County District Court with second-degree intentional murder after Regis A. Jones  of St. Paul who was shot in the head and died Thursday in the 600 block of Blair Avenue. Police and emergency medical responders found Jones' body in an alley about 11:25 a.m. Friday, according to the criminal complaint. His body, the complaint said,  "had been at that location for some time as it appeared to be frozen." The time of the shooting was put at 6:32 p.m. the previous evening. Williams was arrested Sunday at his sister's home in Shakopee, authorities said. Williams remained jailed Tuesday in lieu of $2 million bail. His first court appearance is scheduled for Wednesday. Court records did  not list an attorney for him. While the complaint didn't explicitly address a motive for the shooting, Jones' girlfriend said Williams had loaned Jones a gun and wanted it back. But, she said, Jones had already given it to someone else. Williams' criminal history in Minnesota includes convictions for aiding and abetting robbery, assault, illegal weapons possession, domestic assault and fleeing police. Jones' brother, 28-year-old Shawn Jones of St. Paul Park, was shot to death in St. Paul in October 2019. Brothers Brandon and Marcus Baker were convicted and sentenced to prison for the killing. Marcus Baker received a 40-year term, and Brandon Baker received about seven years.
