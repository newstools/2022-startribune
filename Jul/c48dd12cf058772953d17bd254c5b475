MONTREAL — After adding a pair of forwards on Day 1 of the NHL draft, the Wild kept the spotlight on offense by picking center Hunter Haight with its first selection in the second round at No. 47 on Friday at Bell Centre in Montreal. Haight, 18, had 22 goals and 19 assists for 41 points in 63 games last season with Barrie in the Ontario Hockey League. The 18-year-old is considered a smooth skater with strong puck skills who plays a two-way game. The Wild has five more picks, including another in the second round at 56. A day earlier, the team drafted Swedish winger Liam Ohgren and Russian winger Danila Yurov.
