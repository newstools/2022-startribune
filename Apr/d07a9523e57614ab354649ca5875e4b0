BALTIMORE  — A judge on Tuesday granted a request by Baltimore's top prosecutor to postpone her trial on federal criminal charges stemming from her purchase of two Florida vacation homes, court documents show. State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby was scheduled to go to trial next month on charges of making false statements on financial documents to withdraw money from her retirement savings and purchase the houses. U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby granted the request Tuesday and rescheduled the trial for Sept. 19. Mosby's attorneys requested  the postponement last week, saying they needed more time to prepare for the trial. Prosecutors said there was no reason to delay. Previously, defense attorney A. Scott Bolden had said Mosby wanted a trial to start within 60 days of her arraignment on Feb. 4. In a February motion to dismiss the indictment, Mosby alleged that the prosecution is driven by an attempt to hurt her chances of winning reelection. The Democratic primary is scheduled for July 19. In January, a grand jury indicted  Mosby on two counts each of perjury and making a false statement on a loan application in purchasing a home in Kissimmee, Florida, and a condominium in Long Boat Key, Florida. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment accuses Mosby of falsely stating that the COVID-19 pandemic harmed her finances so she could withdraw $90,000 from her city retirement account. Mosby's gross salary in 2020 was over $247,000 and never was reduced, the indictment says. Mosby was first elected in 2014 and rose to national prominence the following year when she pursued criminal charges  against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, a Black man who suffered fatal injuries in police custody. His death sparked protests and riots. None of the officers was convicted. Mosby is married to Baltimore City Council President Nick Mosby. He has not been charged with any crimes.
