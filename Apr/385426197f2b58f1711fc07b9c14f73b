Introduction: 21 different ESPN experts predicted how the Wolves vs. Grizzlies series would turn out, and all 21 picked Memphis. The Wolves are surely using perceptions like that as fuel as they try to take a 2-0 series lead Tuesday in Memphis, host Michael Rand said. 7:00: Star Tribune columnist La Velle E.
