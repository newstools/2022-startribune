A woman jailed since Sunday on suspicion of fatally shooting a 59-year-old man at a senior housing apartment building was released Tuesday without being charged. Police said Monday that the man killed Friday night at the complex in the 700 block of E. 7th Street was Leonardo Bedell of St. Paul. Police were called to the building shortly before 7 p.m. to conduct a welfare check. Officers found Bedell inside the apartment, dead from a gunshot wound. A 49-year-old woman was arrested Sunday afternoon in the 1500 block of Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis on suspicion of murder. She left jail Tuesday without charges as the investigation continues, said Dennis Gerhardstein, spokesman for the Ramsey County Attorney's Office. The Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged. There have been 19 homicides in St. Paul so far this year.
