Minneapolis firefighters battled a fire Thursday in a vacant building under renovation at Fort Snelling. The fire was "starting to be under control" by about 6 p.m., around three hours after crews arrived at the three-story brick building at 6271 Taylor Av.  Area traffic cameras at the time showed the blaze was visible from some distance, including from nearby highways. Construction workers were all accounted for, the Fire Department said. Two firefighters suffered minor burns when melting tar was blown from the roof. No other injuries were reported. The building was not part of the Fort Snelling complex that was recently reopened to the public. Some other buildings at the site are being converted to affordable housing, although it wasn't immediately clear whether the building that caught fire was one of them. The Fire Department said crews laid lines for a defensive exterior fire attack due to the heavy amount of flames coming from the building's third floor and roof. Backup crews were called in, and an aerial tower was set up to extinguish the fire, which intensified from blustery winds. The cause of the fire will be investigated.
