A bicyclist was hit by a light-rail train late Wednesday morning in St. Paul and died, authorities said. The collision involving a westbound Green Line train occurred about 10:30 a.m. at the Raymond Avenue Station along University Avenue, said Metro Transit spokeswoman Laura Baenen. Baenen did not know other details about the incident, including the approximate age of the bicyclist or the person's gender. Two witnesses said the victim was a man. One witness wrote on Facebook that he heard the impact of the train hitting the bicyclist and "ran out to see if I could help." He said the train traveled more than a block from where the bicyclist was hit until the train came to a halt. Michael Hussey, who also lives nearby, came out to the scene and saw the man trapped between the first and second cars. "No one in the crowd knew first aid/CPR," the witness' Facebook account continued, "but 911 told us to turn the man on his back, so we did. ... An officer arrived and began CPR. Medics arrived quickly after that and took over."
