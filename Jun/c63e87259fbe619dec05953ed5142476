A 40-year-old Minneapolis man has been sentenced to more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to fatally shooting his brother when he awoke at his family's home and inexplicably opened fire.  Fong Vang pleaded guilty last week in Hennepin County District Court to second-degree manslaughter in the death of 38-year-old Dan Vang on April 28 in the 2000 block of N. James Avenue. He was sentenced to five years and seven months. With credit for time in jail since his arrest, Vang is expected to serve about three years and eight months in prison and the balance on supervised release. According to the complaint: On the night of the shooting, Vang told police he had recently lost his own place and moved in temporarily with his two brothers and mother. He said it was his habit to keep a handgun at his side when he slept. Vang said he awoke sometime after 11:30 p.m. after hearing the front door make a loud noise. He admitted shooting Dan Vang as his brother returned from work, but he was at a loss as to why he shot him. Vang said he had to load the gun before firing it.
