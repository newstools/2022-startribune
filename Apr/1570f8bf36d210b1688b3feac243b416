CEO Pay Watch: The stock of SPS Commerce had a total return from 2019 to 2021 that far exceeded the return of the Russell 2000 Index. As a result, CEO Archie Black earned the maximum payouts on his restricted stock during that time and his compensation increased 6% last year.    Note: Black became CEO of the Minneapolis-based provider of software that connects retail trading partners in 2001. His total compensation increased 6% from his $14.5 million total in 2020. His salary was unchanged from 2020 but his annual cash incentive increased 138% over the prior year to $920,480. The bulk of Black's compensation in 2021, and in prior years, was from previously issued long-term equity awards that vested or he exercised during the year. His restricted stock awards are a combination of time-based and performance based stock units. About 45% of the equity awards each year are in time-based restricted stock that vest after four years and 55% from performance stock units vest based on total shareholder return relative to the Russell 2000 Index. From 2019 to 2021 SPS Commerce's total shareholder return was 242%, compared to the Russell 2000 Index's 58% return. That overperformance earned Black the maximum award for that period. The combined value of the restricted stock units and performance stock units was $8.1 million. Up from $2.5 million from restricted stock that vested in 2020. In addition during 2021 Black exercised 51,052 stock options that were granted in previous years for $5.8 million. Black's bonus from the firm's annual management incentive plan, based on revenue and earnings, was one of the largest of his tenure. For 2021 SPS Commerce's adjusted net income was $107 million, well above the threshold for an award and just below the maximum incentive target of $108.2 million. Annual revenue was $385 million, above the maximum target for the plan in 2021.
