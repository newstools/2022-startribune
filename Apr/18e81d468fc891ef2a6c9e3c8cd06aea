Ben Goessling and Michael Rand take a two weeks out look at the NFL draft and try to project what the Vikings will do with the No. 12 pick. Almost everyone is projecting them to take a cornerback — which is a smart and logical move — but other options are in play. Plus Goessling and Rand will get into Kirk Cousins' comments earlier in the week about retiring as a member of the Vikings and answer a bunch of burning listener questions.
