Gophers wrestler Brayton Lee, an All-America at 157 pounds, will miss the rest of the season with an unspecified injury sustained in last Friday's meet against Ohio State. A redshirt junior from Brownsburg, Ind., Lee went 16-2 this season, with seven wins against ranked opponents. He is ranked No. 4 nationally in his weight class. "We're obviously heartbroken for Brayton that he won't be able to compete this postseason," Gophers coach Brandon Eggum said in the news release. "Nobody loves to compete more than him and he was having a fantastic season, but our primary concern for him right now is to get healthy so that he can come back stronger next season." Lee will undergo surgery to repair the injury and is expected to make a full recovery, the team said. He has up to two more years of eligibility remaining. — Joe Christensen Cambria College Classic returns The Gophers baseball team announced the return of the Cambria College Classic March 4-6 at U.S. Bank Stadium.
