A man was shot to death  Friday morning in north Minneapolis and  two people were arrested in what is the city's 13th homicide in April. About 8:30 a.m., officers responding to a report of gunfire arrived to the 2400 block of N. Emerson Avenue and saw a wounded and unconscious man on the ground, police said. Officers provided medical aid until Fire Department personnel and emergency medical responders took over. Despite those efforts, the man died at the scene, police said. Police quickly apprehended a man who ran from the scene of the shooting, and they also arrested a woman without incident. Guns were seized from both of them, police said. The victim's identity has yet to be released, and police have not addressed a possible motive for the shooting.
