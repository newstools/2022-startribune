Twin Cities Summer Jam is coming back for a third year in July, with two nights of big-name country stars and one night of local rockers. Kane Brown and Blake Shelton headline the country nights at Canterbury Park on July 22 and 23, respectively, while Hairball, the popular theatrical hard-rockers, will kick things off on July 21 with low-buck tickets. TC Summer Jam has portrayed itself as a diverse festival by presenting country, rock, pop and party music often on the same day. Shelton, the popular mentor on NBC's "The Voice," has enjoyed 27 No. 1 country singles and two recent hits with his wife, Gwen Stefani. He last performed in the Twin Cities in 2019 at Xcel Energy Center. Also appearing July 23 will be country stalwart Trace Adkins, rising Nashville newcomer Elvie Shane, veteran Southern rockers .38 Special and Midwest country-rockers Mason Dixon Line. Brown, who impressed in January in his first local arena headline appearance at Target Center, has chalked up seven No. 1s, including "Heaven" and "Famous Friends." He will be joined July 22 by "Hot in Herre" rapper Nelly, teen TikTok sensation Kidd G, teen country thrush Callista Clark and harmony-loving country group Restless Road. In addition to Hairball, the opening-niught showcase of Minnesota acts July 21 will feature the Fabulous Armadillos plus aspiring country singer Anderson Daniels. TC Summer Jam launched in 2019 with Aerosmith, Tim McGraw, REO Speedwagon, Pitbull and Rascal Flatts. After a 2020 COVID hiatus, the fest returned last year with Carrie Underwood, Zac Brown Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. All tickets — including single-day, two-day, and three-day — will go on sale Friday at tcsummerjam.com. Prices will increase after March 18.
