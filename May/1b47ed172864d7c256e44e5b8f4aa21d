A primary in southern Minnesota's first Congressional district is being held Tuesday in the race to replace the late GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn in Congress. A packed field of Republicans is seeking to win the primary to advance to the Aug. 9 special election, as Democrats try to win back control of what was once seen as a swing seat. Twenty candidates in total filed to run in the special election. Prominent Republicans in the race include Jennifer Carnahan, the former state Republican party chair who is Hagedorn's widow, GOP state Rep. Jeremy Munson and former United States Department of Agriculture official Brad Finstad. Former Hormel Foods CEO Jeff Ettinger has emerged as the frontrunner in the DFL field that also includes former political consultant Sarah Brakebill-Hacke and Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer who served in President George W. Bush's administration. Hagedorn died in February after a lengthy battle with kidney cancer, which created the open seat. The sprawling First District includes large portions of rural farmland as well as regional centers such as Mankato, Winona and Rochester, home of the Mayo Clinic. It also runs along Minnesota's entire southern border with Iowa. The winner of the August election will serve the remainder of Hagedorn's second term in Congress which ends in January. In November, voters will decide who represents the redrawn district for a full two-year term under the new lines put in place because of the once-a-decade redistricting process. Republicans have an advantage in both the old and new versions of the district. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. according to the secretary of state's website.
