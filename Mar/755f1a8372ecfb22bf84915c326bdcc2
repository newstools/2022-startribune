A man suspected of fatally stabbing his wife Monday night in Champlin has been arrested. Officers in Fargo, N.D., took the 44-year-old man into custody without incident just after 4 a.m. Tuesday when they learned he was in an apartment in the 1300 block 13th Avenue S., Fargo police spokeswoman Katie Ettish said. The suspect was taken to the Cass County, N.D., jail, where he was being held as a "fugitive from justice" Tuesday afternoon, records show. Champlin Police Chief Ty Schmidt  identified the man as the victim's husband. Events unfolded about 9:38 p.m. Monday when police responded to a call about a woman lying in the front yard of a residence on Thousand Pines Entry. Officers arrived and found the 35-year-old Champlin woman not breathing, Schmidt said. Thousand Pines Entry is a two-block street east of 114th Avenue N. and Douglas Drive, leading to Pines Park. Officers from the Champlin Police Department and two other departments and firefighters from the Anoka-Champlin Fire Department attempted lifesaving efforts but were unsuccessful, Schmidt said. Investigators have recovered three weapons as of Tuesday afternoon, Schmidt said. The suspect left the scene and abandoned a vehicle in the area of 101st and Winnetka avenues N. in neighboring Brooklyn Park, according to that city's police department. Law enforcement from several agencies, including a K-9 team from Brooklyn Park and the Minnesota State Patrol air unit, searched for the suspect. It was not immediately clear how the suspect got to Fargo or why he was in the apartment where he was found. The woman's death was the north metro suburb's first homicide of 2022.
