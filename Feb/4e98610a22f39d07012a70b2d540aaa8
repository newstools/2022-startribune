Dave Schwartz, the weekend sports anchor for KARE, announced Wednesday that he is leaving the station to join the Minnesota Wild organization. A spokesperson for the Wild said Schwartz will serve as senior manager for internal communications and engagement. "Fourteen years is a long time," Schwartz tweeted Wednesday in a note thanking the station, the people he has covered and viewers. "I've had the good fortune of being able to pack it with a lifetime of amazing experiences and I'm grateful for each one. In the words of Dr. Seuss — don't cry that it's over, be happy that it happened." And, he said he was. Schwartz has been in the news business for 20 years. Before coming to the Twin Cities in 2007, he worked in Louisiana and Bemidji. The sports anchor has made no secret over the years about his love for hockey. He played junior hockey in Elmira, N.Y., and has written columns for Minnesota Hockey magazine. Schwartz's last day at KARE will be Sunday.
