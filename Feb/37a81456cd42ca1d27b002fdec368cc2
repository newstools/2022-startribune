In "Who are we planning for?" (Opinion Exchange, Feb 10), John Widen lists groups whom he says will "clearly not" support the push toward transit and biking: family men and women, the elderly and the disabled. Yet many transit riders, myself included, belong to one or more of these groups. There is no such thing as a "typical" transit rider. However, it is worth describing some groups of people who regularly ride the bus with me: Many people tell me that what I do is impossible: That there is simply no way to have a family without having a car. If reading this makes you feel that way, then you clearly recognize just how much our current system favors those who drive. Having realized this bias in favor of cars, I hope that you will want to give better support to those for whom driving is not an option. Given how much our current system favors those who drive, it is natural to ask drivers to make some small sacrifices to make life a bit easier for those who cannot drive. In any case, eliminating parking spots doesn't force any one person to give up on driving: If transit becomes more convenient and there is an uptick in ridership, this will free up parking spots even if you personally still use a car. Please support a transportation system that works for everyone, including those whose life circumstances prevent them from driving. Andrew Cantrell lives in Minneapolis.
