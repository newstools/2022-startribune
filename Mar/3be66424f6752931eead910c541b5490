If you've been feeling helpless watching footage from Ukraine and are seeking a way to help the people of that war-torn country, you can do so this Sunday and enjoy some very good performances of chamber music, as well. The Isles Ensemble will perform a benefit concert for the people of Ukraine, with all donations being given to Eastern Europe Crisis Response and Lutheran Disaster Response. The ensemble is group of outstanding Twin Cities classical musicians — some of them current and former members of the Minnesota Orchestra and St. Paul Chamber Orchestra — who perform chamber music every couple of months or so at a church by Minneapolis' Lake of the Isles. Sunday's program will feature works by Ukrainian composers, as well as Antonin Dvorak and Peter Tchaikovsky. The concert is at 2 p.m. at the Woman's Club of Minneapolis Auditorium, 410 Oak Grove St. in Minneapolis. All admissions are by donation.
