Just when it seems like we can't catch a break from winter, something warm and wonderful comes along, something like the Spring Flower Show at the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum. The show features 17 romantic and whimsical displays bursting with fresh flowers and greenery, hanging plants and fanciful arrangements. The displays are built around outdoor seating areas designed to inspire visitors to create their own oases at home. "The intent is to get the whole room with décor, up and down," said Wendy Composto, arboretum signature seasonal events manager, who worked with Jewel Engstrom, an arboretum landscape gardener. Displays include a tabletop fairy garden, a plant-filled patio and a lush wall of roses. The show also features arrangements of sunny yellow daffodils, fragrant lilies and colorful carnations as well as orchids, lady slippers and bromeliads. In the conservatory, pops of colorful plants have been added to the existing jungle of plants that dwell there. Whether in the displays or the conservatory, the emphasis is on keeping flowers and plants fresh. "We keep swapping out and freshening up daily," Engstrom said. In addition to growing things, the show lets patio furnishings, fountains and art share the spotlight. Look for works by local artists, including blown glass floral chandeliers by Andrew Rock of Fluid Philosophy and sculptures from Cynthia Anderson, Dennis Kalow, Jon Kamrath and Paul Olson. The show runs from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. daily through Feb. 27. Tickets are still available for "After Hours With the Flowers" on Feb. 24, with live music by Paul Imholte. Dinner will be available at the cafeteria. For more information, arboretum.umn.edu.
