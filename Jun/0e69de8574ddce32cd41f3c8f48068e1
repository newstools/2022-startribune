 Al Franken's comedy tour has mostly consisted of performances in theaters. But he's making an exception for the Twin Cities. The former senator has announced that he'll be doing stand-up at Minneapolis' Acme Comedy Co., a venue that seats about 300 people. Fans can catch him there Aug. 17-20 for $27.75. Franken, one of the first writers for "Saturday Night Live," returned to his comedy roots last summer, popping up in New York clubs before launching a nationwide tour that included a stop at Minneapolis' Pantages Theatre. He also hosts a weekly podcast that features interviews with journalists, politicians and comedians. "A lot of people think, 'Oh, he's had all these different kinds of jobs,' " he told the Star Tribune last September. "And to me, in a way, it's just been one job, which is communicating what I want to communicate. And comedy is one way to do it. ... Obviously, the emphasis is different when you're a senator than when you're on a TV show." He resigned from the U.S. Senate in 2017 after multiple women alleged he had inappropriately touched or kissed them. To purchase tickets, visit acmecomedy.seatengine.com
