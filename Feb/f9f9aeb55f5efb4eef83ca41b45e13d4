A 61-year-old man was found dead near his burned-out pickup truck after an accident Friday northwest of Duluth, authorities said.   The man had struck a trailer and a sand berm "before becoming stuck" in the 8000 block of Hwy. 2 near Saginaw, the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office said. "At some point, the vehicle caught on fire." Shortly before 11 p.m. Friday, a woman went looking for the man and found the truck and the man's body on the ground, the Sheriff's Office said. He had suffered burns, smoke inhalation and apparent injuries from the collision, the Medical Examiner's Office said.
