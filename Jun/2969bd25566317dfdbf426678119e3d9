High schoolers from all over Minnesota collectively earned more than 100 National Merit Scholarships in 2022. Two suburban schools produced a substantial number of this year's recipients. Wayzata High in Plymouth produced the single largest number of recipients at 15. Ten winners attend Mounds View High in Arden Hills. Several other metro-area schools also produced a handful of recipients. Edina and Minnetonka high schools claimed seven and six winners, respectively, and five recipients attend the Blake School in Minneapolis. The National Merit Scholarship Corp. announced the 2022 winners in four batches. The organization announced 15 winners from Minnesota in late April and another 45 in mid-May. Sixty-six winners were announced June 1 and another batch June 11. The National Merit Scholarship Program did not provide the final batch as of press time. The organization honors students based on standardized test scores and academic achievements. Minnesota students who earned a 218 or higher on the PSAT in 2020 qualified for this year's awards. Candidates then submitted a scholarship application that included an essay, list of extracurriculars and an endorsement from a teacher or administrator. They also had to maintain a consistently high academic performance and earn an SAT or ACT score on par with that of their PSAT. The National Merit program estimates about 16,000 students qualified for this year's awards based on their 2020 PSAT scores, representing less than 1% of high school seniors nationwide. The organization released its list of 2022 recipients in four batches. April's announcement included winners backed by companies. Those recipients were awarded either annual stipends that range from $1,000 to $10,000 per year or onetime payments of $2,500 to $5,000. In May, the organization announced its list of 2,500 Merit Scholars, 45 of them from Minnesota. Each recipient was awarded $2,500. June's winners were sponsored by colleges and universities they plan on attending. Those students will receive $500 to $2,000 annually for up to four years.
