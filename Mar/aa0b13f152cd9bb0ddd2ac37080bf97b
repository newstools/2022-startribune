A St. Paul man has admitted to serving as a straw buyer in a scheme that illegally put nearly 100 guns on the street. Authorities said they recovered 18 of the guns at crimes scenes or in the possession of people who were barred from having firearms. Geryiell L. Walker, 22, pleaded guilty Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis to aiding and abetting false statements made during the purchase of firearms. Walker is scheduled to be sentenced July 27. The process known as "straw purchasing" is a significant driver of the illegal gun market in Minneapolis and St. Paul, authorities say. In typical straw purchases, buyers have no felony convictions or other factor disqualifying them from owning a firearm. But they are actually buying the weapons for others who are either legally ineligible or don't want records linking them to the weapons. According to court documents: From May 2020 to May 2021, Walker and co-defendants Sarah Jean Elwood,  34, and Jeffrey P. Jackson, 31, both of Crystal, conspired to make the illegal purchases. Elwood, who at the time had a permit to carry a firearm, would buy guns from various licensed sellers on behalf of Walker and others. The deals included a $100 premium for each straw-purchased gun on top of the price paid for the weapon. The defendants illegally bought a total of about 97 firearms, including 62 last May alone. So far, 18 have been recovered at  crime scenes or in the possession of people who were prohibited from having firearms.  Authorities said several of the recovered guns were linked to shootings that happened within weeks after Elwood had bought them. The U.S. Attorney's Office last summer charged Elwood and Jackson with five counts related to the straw buys. Both pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting, and making false statements during the purchase of a firearm. Jackson is scheduled to be sentenced April 26 and Elwood on May 11.
