Jost, a 5-11, 187-pound bottom-six winger with the Avalanche, has six goals and eight assists in 59 games this season. The 24-year-old is in his sixth NHL season, racking up 103 career points in 321 games after getting drafted in the first round 10th overall by Colorado in 2016. Jost, who played one season at North Dakota, has one season left on a two-year, $4 million contract. He'll be a restricted free agent when that deal expires after 2022-23.
