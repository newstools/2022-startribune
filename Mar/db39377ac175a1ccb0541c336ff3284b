Life Time's offering was downsized in the days leading up to the pricing on Oct. 7 but still raised $702 million by selling 39 million shares at $18 a share. In March 2020, in response to COVID-19, and the need for the company to preserve cash, Akradi cut his $1 million annual salary to zero for the remainder of the year. He also agreed not to take any annual bonus he might have earned. He also agreed to cut all but $50,000 of his annual salary and bonus in 2021. For 2021, in lieu of the salary and bonus opportunity, the compensation committee agreed to grant Akradi 500,000 shares of preferred stock and 525,714 restricted stock units. Those equity awards had a grant date value of $23.9 million.
