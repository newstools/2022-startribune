A child was taken from a home Saturday night in south Minneapolis for what authorities said was a possible drowning in a pool. The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office Water Patrol was called to a large residence in the 2200 block of S. Pillsbury Avenue shortly before 8 p.m. "on a report of a possible drowning in a pool," said sheriff's spokesman Andy Skoogman. Emergency medical personnel performed lifesaving measures on a child at the scene, Skoogman said. The child was then taken from the 119-year mansion-like home to HCMC for further treatment. Authorities had no other information to release Saturday night.
