FORT MYERS, FLA. — Josh Donaldson's career as a Twin lasted 163 games. Isiah Kiner-Falefa's career as a Twin didn't last that many hours. The Twins' blitzkrieg roster makeover went into high gear Sunday night when they traded their biggest free-agent signing ever to the Yankees, and included Saturday's prize acquisition with him. In exchange for Donaldson (and relief from paying him the $51.5 million he's still owed) and Kiner-Falefa, whose reign as Twins shortstop lasted one day, Minnesota received Yankees infielder Gio Urshela and defrocked catcher Gary Sanchez. The trade, the third major deal agreed to by the Twins in roughly 36 hours, overhauls their lineup and frees up payroll space that will allow them to do … what, exactly? More moves seem to be looming, and Derek Falvey, president of baseball operations, has demonstrated he has no qualms about shaking up a roster that went 73-89 last season. Urshela, a 30-year-old Colombian who has largely been a third baseman during his six-year career with Cleveland and New York, can also play shortstop, and allows the Twins to sort out those two positions between him, rookie Jose Miranda, and holdovers Jorge Polanco and Luis Arraez. Sanchez is a 29-year-old catcher who has bashed 138 home runs in his first six major-league seasons, including a few memorable ones against the Twins, but whose subpar defense had the Yankees looking for other options. The Twins added one other possibility to the trade, sending defense-first catcher Ben Rortvedt to New York. . . . This is a breaking news story. Continue to check startribune.com for more updates.
