Three men were arrested and two guns seized after a parking lot disturbance Wednesday evening during graduation exercises at Brooklyn Center High School, police said. School officials said the three men, who were believed to be armed, were removed from the ceremony at 6500 Humboldt Av. N., the Brooklyn Center Police Department said.  The incident took place as about 200 students were awarded their diplomas in the school's football stadium, said Olivia Doeden, a school district spokeswoman. No Brooklyn Center students were involved in the altercation, and the men were not former students, she said. "Due to the swift response of staff and law enforcement, the incident was safely addressed without disturbance to the graduation ceremony," the district said in a statement. Police remained on scene for the remainder of the ceremony. Witnesses' descriptions of the men led police to an apartment, where the three were arrested. Police said one of the seized handguns had been stolen in Brooklyn Park; the other did not have a serial number.  The men were taken to the Hennepin County jail on suspicion of weapons offenses. Charges were pending. After the graduation ceremony ended, the school district said, another disturbance broke out on the football field when three men assaulted one of the new graduates. Police and school staff intervened to stop the altercation. The three assailants were not students.  "The events that occurred at commencement this year have prompted district administration to rethink the way we celebrate these joyous events to ensure the safety of all students, staff and families," the district said. "We are also working collaboratively with the city and law enforcement to conduct an after-action review in order to process response and plan together as we move forward."
