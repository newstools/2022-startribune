 As Twin Cities companies find new ways of dealing with COVID challenges, History Theatre has canceled two performances of its world premiere of "Runestone!" Both Thursday shows — a matinee and evening performance — were canceled because of "COVID cases within the artistic team." Still on are 7:30 p.m. shows Friday and Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday. For information, visit historytheatre.com or call 651-292-4323. "Runestone!" is scheduled to close May 29.
