Two things seem to be true about how former Minnehaha Academy and Gonzaga star Chet Holmgren is perceived by most high-profile NBA mock drafts: He is the most intriguing prospect in next week's real draft, and there's little chance he'll be the first player selected. If the consensus is correct, that honor will go to Auburn small forward Jabari Smith. Orlando, Oklahoma City, Houston and Sacramento currently hold the top four picks in Thursday's draft (6:30 p.m., ESPN). For the Magic, the idea of teaming the 7-foot Holmgren with former high school teammate Jalen Suggs is tantalizing. But Orlando already has three unique big men on  its roster in Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr. and Mo Bamba. With Smith the projected No. 1 pick, where does Holmgren land? There is a consensus: ESPN: Holmgren selected No. 2 overall by Oklahoma City CBS Sports: Holmgren selected No. 2 The Ringer: Holmgren selected No. 2 NBC Sports: Holmgren selected No. 2 Yahoo Sports: Holmgren selected No. 2 NBADraft.net: Holmgren selected No. 4 by Sacramento Not everyone believes Holmgren is out of the race for the first overall selection. USA Today: Holmgren selected No. 1 Orlando No matter where Holmgren lands, one thing is certain, he is confident in his ability to be a generational talent in the NBA. During the lottery, he appeared on ESPN and said he already has a clear goal. That means shooting 50% from the field, 40% from three and 90% from the free throw line for an entire season. Only nine players in NBA history have accomplished it: Larry Bird, Malcolm Brogdon, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki and Mark Price. Last year at Gonzaga,  Holmgren shot 61% from the field, 39% from three and 72% at the line. Care to go deeper into the world of mock drafts? Here is a frquently-updated database of more than 20 mock drafts, including several lower-profile sites that have Holmgren or Duke forward Paolo Banchero going first overall.
