HEATSTROKE AND HEAT EXHAUSTION What is heat stroke? It is a serious medical emergency where the body's temperature rises above the normal level and the body is unable to cool itself. Heat stroke can cause long-term damage, injury and even death if left untreated, according to HCMC. Symptoms include high body temperature (103 F or above), loss of sweating, severe headache, red or flushed dry skin, rapid pulse, dizziness, confusion or even unconsciousness. What to do? Seek immediate medical attention. What is heat exhaustion? It is a milder form of heat-related illness that sometimes can lead to heat stroke. Heat exhaustion happens when the body loses water and salt as a result of excessive sweating. Among the symptoms are fatigue, dizziness, heavy sweating, paleness, muscle cramps, headache, nausea or vomiting and even fainting. What to do? Hydrate, move to a cooler place and rest. If symptoms get worse, seek medical help immediately. Find a cooling center Cooling spaces are available for the public during extreme heat events. Libraries, shopping malls, community and recreation centers and movie theaters are good choices, but check if the sites are open on the official Juneteenth holiday. Government buildings reopen Tuesday as cooling sites, too. For a list of cooling places, click on the links below. Hennepin County  or call 612-543-5200. Ramsey County or call 651-266-8500.
