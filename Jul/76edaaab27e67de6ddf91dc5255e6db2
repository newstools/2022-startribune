Charges are being weighed against a teenage driver who authorities say was speeding Thursday before hitting a tree in Ham Lake and seriously injuring everyone in the vehicle. The wreck occurred about 11:30 p.m. in the 16800 block of NE. Xylite Street, the Anoka County Sheriff's Office said Friday. The SUV was heading south "at a high rate of speed" on Xylite when it hit the tree, the Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff's spokeswoman Tierney Peters said that the "driver's name is being withheld at this time pending consideration of charges," depending on what the Sheriff's Office and the State Patrol learn as they investigate the crash. The driver and the other five in the SUV "sustained serious injuries and are being treated at local hospitals," Peters said. The Sheriff's Office identified the passengers as: Payton Nicole Kaufman, of New Brighton; Berit Kathleen Hudson, of Arden Hills; Lauren Elyse Coffey, of Arden Hills; Landon Joseph Pederson, of Blaine; and Brendon Doyle Hammer, of Andover.
