A forensic scientist who works for the Minneapolis Police Department was shot multiple times Wednesday evening while off duty in the Prospect Park neighborhood. Nicole Lenway, a supervisor for the crime scene lab, was taken to a hospital for gunshot injuries. The shooting is being investigated as a domestic assault, according to two sources familiar with the incident, who were not permitted to speak on the record. A police report says the shooting occurred at First Step Early Childhood Education Center on University and Malcolm avenues SE., around 7:30 p.m. According to emergency dispatch audio obtained by the Star Tribune, "at the time there was a large group of parents trying to pick up children at this location," a dispatcher said. "They're all now trying to hide and duck for cover." A person was seen running away from the shooting wearing a dark hoodie, the audio continued, and a victim was shot in the neck and arm. A Minneapolis police officer set up a GoFundMe account this week to help raise money for Lenway's medical bills. "Last night, gun violence hit home," reads the post, organized by officer Nate Sundberg. "While off duty, one of our own, Nicki Lenway, suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was immediately transported to a local hospital. She is in stable condition and has been in this fight since the word GO." Lenway has worked for the city of Minneapolis since 2013, according to her LinkedIn account. She is a graduate of Hamline University. Minneapolis police spokesman officer Garrett Parten declined to provide any information on the shooting. "Out of respect for the wishes of her loved ones, MPD won't be commenting except to say that we're holding Nicole and all of her loved ones in our hearts during this time," Parten said in an e-mail.
